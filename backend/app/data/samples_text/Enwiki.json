  "Tony Bianchi\n\nTony Bianchi (5 April 1952 \u2013 2 July 2017) was a prize-winning novelist, poet, short-story writer and critic, writing in both Welsh and English.\n\nEarly life\n\nTony Bianchi was born in North Shields, near Newcastle-upon-Tyne. His father was a policeman of Italian ancestry. He attended a Catholic school on Tyneside, then studied English & Philosophy at St David's University College in Lampeter, Wales.\n\nBianchi obtained a doctoral degree with a thesis on Samuel Beckett. While studying in Wales, he met his future wife, Diana, who was an activist Welsh speaker, and who instilled a passion for the language in him. They had two daughters, Rhiannon and Heledd, named after early Welsh literary figures.\n\nCareer\n\nBianchi's first job was as a teacher of English in Flintshire and Aberystwyth. He then became Literature Officer (and subsequently Literature Director) at the Welsh Arts Council in Cardiff - an organisation that provided him with material for his first novel Esgyrn Bach. Bianchi's literary life took off after his retirement from the Arts Council in 2002. He became a prolific novelist as well as a skillful poet, well-versed in the intricacies of the strict metres of Welsh poetry and winning numerous prizes and plaudits. He lived in Cardiff with his partner Ruth until his death in 2017 aged 65. He was an avid supporter of Newcastle United; an excellent pianist; a frequent (bilingual) contributor to debates in the Conway pub about beer, politics, language, history, music, football, philosophy, random irritants, and the tendency of people to leave doors open; a valued member of the local Twlc at Y Mochyn Du; and a fan of both the coffee and the company at Caban bookshop.\n\nWritings in Welsh\n\nHis first novel, Esgyrn Bach came out in 2006, and his second Pryfeta in 2009. Pryfeta won the Daniel Owen Memorial Prize at the National Eisteddfod.\n\nHis collection of short stories, Cyffesion Geordi oddi Cartref (2011), was semi-autobiographical, introducing the friends of his youth, and describing the bullying he faced at school, as well as his mixed feelings towards his tyrannical father. Some stories were fantasies and were met with bafflement on the part of Welsh language readers on account of their technical complexity.\n\nHis novel Dwy Farwolaeth Endaf Rowlands won the Prose Medal at the National Eisteddfod in 2015, sealing his fame as a superb exponent of Welsh language in the 21st century. The book delves into the thoughts of Tomos Rowlands who is obsessed with sounds and tries to make sense of his life through them.\n\nBianchi won the Micro-fiction Prize at the 2017 Anglesey Eisteddfod. A collection of his Welsh-language poetry and micro-fiction, Rhwng Pladur A Blaguryn (Between the Scythe and the Green Shoot), will be published by Barddas in August 2018. The title is taken from one of the poems: ''Rhwng pladur a blaguryn \u2013 rhwng afal a\u2019r anghofio sydyn: rhwng y gwaed a\u2019r angau gwyn; o wynfa I bla: trwch blewyn.''\n\nWritings in English\n\nBumping, which came out in 2010, was Bianchi's only English-language novel, and narrated themes of home, vicissitudes of youth and the delusions of old age. A posthumous collection of short stories Staring Back at Me was published by Cinnamon Press in May 2018.\n\nBianchi also translated several of his works into English: Pryfeta (Daniel's Beetles), Ras Olaf Harri Selwyn (Harri Selwyn\u2019s Last Race), Esgyrn Bach (The Bone Pickers).\n\nAcademic writings\n\nBesides his literary works, Bianchi also contributed to the academy with a monograph on Richard Vaughan as well an anthology of Welsh poetry titled Blodeugerdd Barddas o Farddoniaeth Gyfoes (2005).\n\nBianchi was made a Fellow of the Welsh Academy of Writers.",
  "Cherry barb\n\nThe cherry barb (Puntius titteya) is a tropical freshwater fish belonging to the family Cyprinidae. It is native to Sri Lanka, and introduced populations have become established in Mexico and Colombia. The cherry barb was named Puntius titteya by Paules Edward Pieris Deraniyagala in 1929. Synonyms include Barbus titteya and Capoeta titteya.\n\nThe species is commercially important in the aquarium trade and farmed in larger numbers, but it remains threatened by overcollection and habitat loss.\n\nDescription\n\nThe cherry barb is a small elongated fish with a relatively compressed body. It reaches 5 cm in length. The female is fawn-colored on top with a slight greenish sheen. Its sides and belly have gleaming silver highlights. It may have a rosy tone on its back and upper sides. A horizontal stripe extends from the tip of the snout through the eye to the base of the caudal fin. The male has a reddish color, becoming very deep red when breeding, and a more slender body shape. The females have two pinkish color stripes down their sides, also becoming darker when ready to breed.\n\nHabitat\n\nThe cherry barb's natural habitat is a heavily shaded, shallow, and calm water body. Its native substrate is silty with leaf cover. It comes from a tropical climate and prefers water with a pH of 6 to 8, a water hardness (dH) of 5 to 19, and a temperature range of 73 \u00b0F to 81 \u00b0F (23 \u00b0C to 27 \u00b0C).\n\nIn the aquarium\n\nThe fish is most often kept in community tanks by aquarium hobbyists. The cherry barb is a schooling fish and is best kept in groups of five or more individuals, though the schools are often less discrete than those of other barbs. Within these schools there will most likely be hierarchy. There should be a ratio of at least two females to one male. The male will constantly harass the females to breed, and if there are multiple females, each can escape the attentions of the male for a time. The average life span is four years, with a maximum around seven years. The tank should have abundant plant material (about two-thirds to three-quarters of the tank), but the fish also needs open space to swim. It tends to hide and will often withdraw under the cover of plants. The younger male is generally peaceful, but a mature male can be aggressive when breeding. Appropriate tankmates include Rasbora and similar calm fish.\n\nBreeding\n\nWhen breeding, the male swims just behind the female, chasing away rival males. The female will spawn 200 to 300 eggs and scatter them on plants and on the substrate. It may eat its own eggs and small fry. The eggs hatch in one to two days and the fry are free-swimming after two more days. After five weeks, the hatchlings will be about 1 cm. long and easily identifiable as cherry barbs.",

  "Eminescu's Linden Tree\n\nEminescu's Linden Tree (Teiul lui Eminescu) is a 500-year-old silver lime (Tilia tomentosa Moench) in Copou Park, Ia\u0219i, Romania.\n\nMihai Eminescu reportedly wrote some of his best works underneath this lime, rendering the tree one of Romania's most important natural monuments and a Ia\u0219i landmark.\n\nAge\n\nAccording to the Iasi Environmental Protection Agency's official data, the tree is approximately 458 years old. A more recent survey conducted using an increment borer, placed the tree at 540 years of age (+- 3%).\n\nCivic symbol\n\nThe tree was used as a civic symbol by the students who protested, in February 2013, against the removal (by felling) of the linden tree alignment in the Ia\u015fi city centre, and its replacement by the local municipality with miniature Japanese shrubs. In November 2015, the decision was reversed following a public referendum on the topic, which resulted in the reinstatement of limes in the city centre.\n\nCurrent status\n\nIn June 2014, Asociatia Dendro-Ornamentala \"Anastasie Fatu Iasi\", backed by the Ia\u015fi Academic Group and the 'Ia\u0219ul Iube\u0219te Teii' ('Iasi Loves Its Linden Trees') civic campaign, with support from 'Asocia\u021bia Peisagi\u0219tilor din Rom\u00e2nia' (ASOP) and 'Centrul de resurse pentru participare publica' (The Resource Center for Public Participation) (CeRe) (Bucharest), warned the City Hall over the tree's near critical condition, and asked for a number of emergency dendrological measures to be taken. Later the same month, the City Hall complied with the request and, under the supervision of ing. dr. Ionel Lupu (President, Asociatia Dendro-Ornamentala \"Anastasie Fatu Iasi\") proceeded to treating the lime with Bordeaux mixture, insect repellent and organic soil enrichments.\n\nOne day after the treatment, joined by local intellectuals and members of the public, ing. dr. Ionel Lupu, Professor Mandache Leocov and Professor Liviu Antonesei gathered near the tree and argued for the replanting of limes in the Iasi city centre, while accusing the City Hall of gross incompetence in managing the city's green spaces.",
  "Ocean Tracking Network\n\nThe Ocean Tracking Network is a research effort using implanted acoustic transmitters to study fish migration patterns. It is based at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia. The technology used by the Ocean Tracking Network comes from the Pacific Ocean Shelf Tracking Project (POST) and the Tagging of Pacific Pelagics (TOPP) project.",
  "Itsukaichi Kaid\u014d\n\nItsukaichi Kaid\u014d (\u4e94\u65e5\u5e02\u8857\u9053) is the historic and current main road between former Itsukaichi (now Akiruno) and Suginami in Tokyo's central suburbs. It generally follows the same road as the Suginami Akiruno Line along Tokyo Metropolitan Road Route 7 (ja).\n\nOverview\n\nAfter Tokugawa Ieyasu entered Edo, he developed Itsukaichi Kaid\u014d for the purpose of transporting timber and charcoal from Itukaichi (now Akiruno) and Hinohara. Initially, the road was called \"Ina Road\", after Ina, a settlement not far east of Itsukaichi. Ina was the source of stones used for restoring Edo Castle and the road developed for transport between these two places. After the restoration of Edo Castle was finished, charcoal became the main product transported and Itsukaichi grew to become more significant than Ina.\n\nAs land was opened up on the Musashino Plateau, the road between the Tama district and Edo developed as one highway.",
  "Cinema of North Korea\n\nThe cinema of North Korea began with the division of Korea and has been sustained since then by the ruling Kim dynasty. Kim Il-sung and his successor Kim Jong-il were both cinephiles and sought to produce propaganda films based on the Juche ideology.\n\nAll film production is supervised by the Workers' Party of Korea and generally concerns propaganda. North Korea has nevertheless produced some non-propaganda films for export to the wider world.\n\nFilm studios\n\nNorth Korea's principal producer of feature films is the Korean Film Studio, a state-run studio founded in 1947 and located outside of Pyongyang. Other North Korean film studios include the Korean Documentary Film Studio (founded in 1946), the April 25 Film Studio of the Korean People's Army (founded in 1959 and previously known as the February 8 Cinema Studio) and the Korean Science and Educational Film Studio (founded in 1953 and also known as the April 26 Children's Film Production House, and Science Educational Korea, or SEK.) These studios produce feature films, documentaries, animated films, children's films and science films. According to a report from 1992, the Korean Feature Film Studio produced about forty films per year, while the other studios together accounted for another forty.\n\nIn addition to its domestic animated productions, SEK has produced animation for foreign companies. Production costs in North Korea are very low, and the quality of animators is well perceived. SEK has done work on such productions as Mondo TV's animated series Pocahontas and King Lion Simba and the films Light Years and Empress Chung.\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Il-sung believed in Lenin's maxim: \"Cinema is the most important of all arts.\" Accordingly, since the country's division, North Korean films have often been used as vehicles for instilling government ideology into the people. A common theme is martyrdom/sacrifice for the nation. The film Fate of a Self-defence Corps Member, based on a novel written by Kim Il-sung during the fight against the Japanese occupation reflects this theme, as does the highly regarded film, Sea of Blood (1969). The latter film comes from a novel telling the story of a woman farmer who becomes a national heroine by fighting the Japanese.\n\nAnother favorite theme is the happiness of the current society. This theme can be seen reflected in titles of feature films like A Family of Workers, A Flowering Village, Rolling Mill Workers, When Apples Are Picked and Girls at a Port. All of these films were awarded the People's Prize before 1974.\n\nProduction estimates\n\nThe number of films produced in North Korea is difficult to determine. In 1992, Asiaweek reported that the country produced about 80 films annually, and a BBC report in 2001 indicated that North Korea was then producing about 60 films a year. In spite of these claims, Johannes Sch\u00f6nherr, an attendee of the 2000 Pyongyang International Film Festival, found little evidence for actual films or titles. He notes that the country offered only one domestic feature and one documentary at their most high-profile film festival, and suggests that the high number of reported films includes short films, cartoons, and short installments of long-running series. He also cites a 1998 North Korean pamphlet containing a list of films which had been made in the country up to 1998. This gives a total of 259 titles, and indicates that the 1980s were the most prolific decade with about 15 to 20 films made yearly.\n\nThe British Film Institute Sight & Sound magazine reported that an average of 20 films per year were made from the 1960s to the early 1990s. However, in the economic hard times following the collapse of the Soviet Union film production reduced, and from 2000 to 2009 only about 5 films per year were made.\n\nFilm festivals\n\nThe Pyongyang International Film Festival, established in 1987 and broadened in scope in 2002, is now held every two years.\n\n1940s and 1950s\n\nAfter the division of Korea following the defeat of the Japanese Empire in WWII, filmmakers in the North and the South sought to produce the first Korean film after the liberation in their respective half of the peninsula. Although South Koreans were first, with Viva Freedom! (1946), North Korea soon followed with My Home Village.\n\nBecause of the secretive nature of the country as well as the lack of film exports, the exact number of feature films produced in North Korea is almost impossible to determine. The Internet Movie Database (IMDb) lists only 165 films produced in North Korea; some of which include foreign co-productions. Two of these were released in the years between the liberation from Japan and the outbreak of the Korean War, Our Construction (Uri Geonseol) (1946) and My Homeland (1949). Five were released during the war, including Righteous War (1950), Boy Partisans (1951) and Again to the Front (1952). These titles suggest that film was used for ideological purposes from the beginning of North Korea's existence as a separate entity.\n\nNearly all studios and film archives were destroyed during the Korean War, and after 1953 studios had to be rebuilt.\n\n1960s and 1970s\n\nA Spinner (1964) and Boidchi annun dchonson (1965) were made in the 1960s. One of the most highly regarded films in North Korea, Sea of Blood, was produced in 1969. The entrance hall to the Korean Feature Film Studio contains a mural of \"Dear Leader\" Kim Jong-il supervising the production of this film. This is a two-part, black and white film. The first part is 125 minutes in duration, and the second is 126 minutes.\n\nKim Il-sung made a famous call for Juche art in 1966, saying, \"Our art should develop in a revolutionary way, reflecting the Socialist content with the national form\". In a 1973 treatise on film entitled On the Art of the Cinema, Kim Jong-il further developed this idea of Juche art into the cinema, claiming that it is cinema's duty to help develop the people into \"true communists\", and as a means \"to completely eradicate capitalist elements\". The ideology-heavy nature of North Korean cinema during the 1970s can be seen in titles such as The People Sing of the Fatherly Leader and The Rays of Juche Spread All Over the World.\n\nPart of this ideological usage of the arts was a treating of the same subjects repeatedly through various art forms. Consequently, the most prominent films of the era took their stories and titles from pre-existing novels, ballets or operas. The film Sea of Blood was also an opera and a symphony, as well as the name of an opera company. Future Minister of Culture, Choe Ik-kyu's The Flower Girl (1972, 130 min.) later was remade as a dance. This film won a special prize and special medal at the 18th International Film Festival, and is one of the more well-known North Korean films of the 1970s.\n\nUnsung Heroes, a 20-part spy film about the Korean War, was released between 1978 and 1981; it achieved notice outside of North Korea two decades later mainly because United States Forces Korea defector Charles Robert Jenkins played a role as a villain and the husband of one of the main characters.\n\n1980s and 1990s\n\nWith 14 listings, the 1980s is the best-represented decade for North Korea at IMDB. A possible turning to less didactic subjects is indicated with a 1986 production of the popular stories like Chunhyang-jon (1980 - 155 min.) and Hong kil dong (1986 - 115 min.). Probably the most well-known North Korean film internationally is the giant-monster epic, Pulgasari (1985), directed by a kidnapped South Korean director Shin Sang-ok. Multi-part films promoting the Juche ideology, including Star of Korea and The Sun of the Nation were also produced in the 1980s. North Korean animation produced for domestic consumption is reportedly less politically dogmatic during this period, resulting in a large adult audience. At least one international co-production has been filmed in North Korea, Ten Zan - Ultimate Mission, directed by Italian director Ferdinando Baldi and starring American Frank Zagarino. Norodom Sihanouk, a filmmaker and former King of Cambodia, was among Kim Il-sung's good friends, allowing him to make up to four films in North Korea beginning with The Mysterious City in 1988, using the country's actors and facilities while in exile away from Cambodia.\n\nIMDB lists only four North Korean films made in the 1990s. Nation and Destiny is a 62-part series of movies produced from 1992\u20132002, on Korean subjects and people like General Choi Duk Shin (parts 1-4) and composer Yun I-sang (parts 5-8).\n\n2000 and Present\n\nThe 2000s appear to be reasonably productive for North Korean cinema, having five listings so far. In a sign of thawing relations, the animated film, Empress Chung (2005), is a co-production of South and North Korea. This film is said to be the first released simultaneously in both countries. Another recent North/South co-production is the 3-D animated television series Lazy Cat Dinga.",
  "Yutian County, Xinjiang\n\nYutian County, also transliterated from Uyghur as Keriya County (\u0643\u06d0\u0631\u0649\u064a\u06d5 \u0646\u0627\u06be\u0649\u064a\u0649\u0633\u0649; ), is a county in Hotan Prefecture, Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, China.

She is the first woman to become a professional Shashmaqom singer. After WW2, she and her husband immigrated to the capital of the Tajik SSR, Stalinabad (Dushanbe) and made her career as a singer there, working since 1950 as a soloist of the Radio Department of the Tajik SSR. Barno Iskhakova was considered one of the greatest modern female singers in the history of Central Asia and Tajikistan. She was married to singer Isroel Badalbayev, although she retained her original surname as a stage name.\n\nHer first song - \"Allah\" won an award in the national review. She is considered a remarkable performer, in the same class as other Tajik stars as Seeno, Davlatmand Kholov, and Daler Nazarov. Iskhakova became was very famous for her rendition of traditional Shashmaqom songs in Tajik and Uzbek, and other songs in Russian, as well as her mother tongue of Bukhori (Judeo-Tajik Language). She was known as the Queen of the Shashmaqom tradition of Tajik music, she sang side by side on the radio and television with other famous performers of the Tajik Soviet Era such as Neriyo Aminov, Rafael Tolmasov, Shoista Mullodzhanova, Hanifa Mavlianova, Rena Galibova, Ahmad Boboqulov, and others. Her repertoire consisted of more than 100 songs.\n\nSince 1980, Iskhakova worked also as a senior teacher of the Oriental Music Department of the Tajik State Institute of Arts in Dushanbe. When Soviet Tajik writer Sadriddin Ayni heard her sing, he called her \"Levicha among women\" for Levi (Levicha) Babakhanov was a famous Bukharian Jewish traditional singer who performed for the last Emir of Bukhara in the early 20th century.

  "Bring the Noize\n\n\"Bring the Noize\" is a hip-hop song by British recording artist M.I.A. from her fourth studio album, Matangi (2013). The track was written by Maya \"M.I.A.\" Arulpragasam, Surkin, Switch, Para One and Hugues Rey, and produced by Switch and Surkin. It references Public Enemy's 1987 song \"Bring the Noise\" and Janis Joplin's track \"Me and Bobby McGee\".\n\nThe track was first previewed in March 2013 as part of Matangi Mix used as the soundtrack to Kenzo's fashion show in Paris. The single was self-released worldwide as a digital download, under exclusive license to Interscope Records, on 18 June 2013, as the second single from the album. \"Bring the Noize\" was performed the at Glastonbury Festival 2014 and during the Matangi Tour.\n\nThe single's cover features Sri Yantra and a little Om sign in the top right corner.\n\nCritical response\n\nThe song received positive feedback from critics. Rolling Stone gave it four out of five stars and its production was praised by Slate as \"terrific\". Stereogum named \"Bring the Noize\" one of M.I.A.'s 10 best songs.\n\nMusic video\n\nThe music video for the song was commissioned by Noisey, part of the Vice network. It was directed by Ben Newman and filmed in 2 days in London. The clip was released on 25 June 2013 on Noisey's website and YouTube channel. A gold-filtered version of the video, dubbed 'Matangi Gold Edition', was released two days later. On 7 November 2016, a day before the 2016 United States presidential election, M.I.A.'s former label Roc Nation removed the video from Noisey's YouTube channel for including the word \"WikiLeaks\", claiming that the song was released while she was under the label and it had rights over it. The video was eventually re-uploaded on M.I.A.'s Vevo on 17 November 2016 under the title \"Bring The Noize (Matangi Street Edition)\".",
  "Uropetala carovei\n\nUropetala carovei (New Zealand bush giant dragonfly) is a giant dragonfly of the family Petaluridae, endemic to New Zealand. Its M\u0101ori name, kapokapowai, means \"water snatcher\", alluding to the water dwelling juvenile stage (nymph), which, like all dragonflies, has a long extendable jaw that shoots out to snatch prey.\n\nDescription\n\nIts yellow and black body can be up to 86 mm long, with a wingspan up to 130 mm, making it the largest dragonfly in New Zealand. Males have petal-shaped hind appendages. Uropetala carovei can be distinguished from the similar Uropetala chiltoni, which occurs in the mountains of the South Island, by its all-black labrum (lacking the large pale blotch on Uropetala chiltoni), and its brown to yellowish leg femur segments (which are black in Uropetala chiltoni).\n\nDistribution\n\nThis species is found throughout New Zealand, mostly in western parts of each island, and especially on the West Coast. They are found in damp areas of native forest.\n\nEcology\n\nThe nymphs tunnel into the soft earth of a stream bank or seepage, where they occupy a chamber half-filled with water for about five years. They emerge at night to seek prey near the burrow entrance. They are sensitive to disturbance so are rarely observed. A slow and noisy flier, its diet is smaller insects, including cicadas, which they can eat on the wing. U. carovei is preyed on in turn by rats, kingfishers and even wasps.",
  "Battle of Gegodog\n\nThe Battle of Gegodog (also spelled Battle of Gogodog) took place in 13 October 1676 during the Trunajaya rebellion, and resulted in the victory of the rebel forces over the Mataram army led by the Crown Prince Pangeran Adipati Anom. Gegodog is located in the northeastern coast of Java, east of Tuban.\n\nPrior to the battle, Trunajaya invaded eastern Java and occupied Surabaya and other towns. King Amangkurat I sent an army to face him, led by the crown prince. The crown prince expected a sham battle from Trunajaya, his former prot\u00e9g\u00e9. However, Trunajaya offered a real fight which resulted in a decisive victory over the much larger royal army. The royal army was routed, and the king's elderly uncle Pangeran Purbaya was killed after leading a futile charge. The rebel victory was followed by further successes - including more conquests and the defections of Mataram subjects into Trunajaya's side.\n\nBackground\n\nPrior to the rebellion, the Madurese nobleman Trunajaya lived in exile in Mataram and had a close relation with the crown prince of Mataram (then known as Pangeran Adipati Anom, future Amangkurat II). Trunajaya's father-in-law and a prominent nobleman Raden Kajoran had introduced him to the crown prince in 1670. Both had a grudge against King Amangkurat I, the crown prince over the execution of Pangeran Pekik, the prince's maternal grandfather, and Trunajaya over his exile and the execution of his father. The two forged a friendship, partly due to this mutual dislike. In 1670 or 1671, Trunajaya left Mataram for his homeland Madura and became its ruler. He used the crown prince's patronage (as well as his own family's name) to gain followers which allowed him to wrest control of the island.\n\nThe Trunajaya rebellion began in 1674 as Trunajaya's forces conducted raids against the cities under Mataram control. In 1676, a rebel army of 9,000 invaded East Java from their base in Madura, and took Surabaya \u2013 the principal city of East Java \u2013 shortly after. The army consisted of East Javanese, Madurese and Makassarese and was led by Trunajaya and his Makassarese ally Karaeng Galesong.\n\nBattle\n\nIn 1676, the King decided to send a large army to suppress the rebellion. The army was much larger than Trunajaya's, but was predominantly made up of conscripted peasants. It also included West Javanese auxiliaries. The king put the crown prince in charge of this army; he was either unaware of the crown prince's role in the rebellion or planned to have him murdered during the campaign. Other princes also joined the army, including the King's uncle Pangeran Purbaya, Sultan Agung's only remaining brother who was almost 80 years old, as well another son of the king Pangeran Singasari who was the crown prince's archenemy.\n\nThe Mataram army marched to Jepara, and then eastwards towards territories controlled by the rebels. It met the rebel army in Gegodog, east of Tuban on the north coast of eastern Java. The Crown Prince initially expected that he and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Trunajaya would only fight a sham battle and then both forces would join against the King. However, Trunajaya betrayed his former friend and patron, and the presence of other princes might have prevented the crown prince from faking the battle. After a long wavering, the prince ordered an attack on 13 October. Trunajaya offered a real battle, which went badly for the royal army. In a desperate effort, the aged Pangeran Purbaya rallied the troops and led a final charge. According to Thomas Stamford Raffles, he \"performed extraordinary feats of valour\", had his horse shot under him and continued to fight on foot, before he was overpowered and slain. The charge failed, and the battle ended in a decisive victory for the rebels. Mataram troops disintegrated and retreated, along with the Crown Prince and other princes, towards the capital.\n\nAftermath\n\nAfter the rebel victory, Javanese defection into Trunajaya's side accelerated, and Trunajaya followed up his victory by further conquests of Mataram's territories. His forces advanced westward along the northern coast, and by January 1677 nearly all of Mataram's northern coast, with the notable exception of Jepara, fell into his hands. Towns as far west as Cirebon submitted to Trunajaya. Jepara did not fall due to the united efforts of the king's military governor there and VOC forces who arrived there from Batavia. The inland advance was slower, but rebel forces under Raden Kajoran would ultimately overrun and sack the capital in June 1677.\n\nFor Mataram, the defeat was disastrous. After the battle, Mataram could only wage a defensive campaign. Its territories, expanded by Sultan Agung decades before, would fall into rebel hands, laid in ruin and their fortifications dismantled, culminating in the  fall of the capital. The rebellion would continue for several more years, and Mataram would be forced to request assistance from the Dutch East India Company (VOC) - in exchange for geopolitical and financial compensations - to turn the tide of the war.\n\nThe crown prince was blamed for the defeat and was accused of colluding with the enemy. After Gedogog, he was replaced by his brothers, Pangeran Martasana and Pangeran Puger, in leading the Mataram forces. After the fall of the capital he fled with his father, and upon his father's death during the retreat, he took the throne as Amangkurat II.",
  "Entropic value at risk\n\nIn financial mathematics and stochastic optimization, the concept of risk measure is used to quantify the risk involved in a random outcome or risk position. Many risk measures have hitherto been proposed, each having certain characteristics. The entropic value at risk (EVaR) is a coherent risk measure introduced by Ahmadi-Javid, which is an upper bound for the value at risk (VaR) and the conditional value at risk (CVaR), obtained from the Chernoff inequality. The EVaR can also be represented by using the concept of relative entropy. Because of its connection with the VaR and the relative entropy, this risk measure is called \"entropic value at risk\". The EVaR was developed to tackle some computational inefficiencies of the CVaR. Getting inspiration from the dual representation of the EVaR, Ahmadi-Javid developed a wide class of coherent risk measures, called g-entropic risk measures. Both the CVaR and the EVaR are members of this class.\n\nDefinition\n\nLet also called the Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence. The dual representation of the EVaR discloses the reason behind its naming.\n\nOptimization\n\nLet seconds. This shows that formulation with the EVaR outperforms the formulation with the CVaR (see for more details).\n\nGeneralization (g-entropic risk measures)\n\nDrawing inspiration from the dual representation of the EVaR given in, one can define a wide class of information-theoretic coherent risk measures, which are introduced in. Let -entropic risk measures see.\n\nDisciplined Convex Programming Framework\n\nThe disciplined convex programming framework of sample EVaR was proposed by Cajas and has the following form:\n\n{{NumBlk|:| is the matrix of uncompounded cumulative returns of assets.\n\nFor other problems like risk parity, maximization of return/risk ratio or constraints on maximum risk levels for EVaR and EDaR, you can see for more details.\n\nThe advantage of model EVaR and EDaR using a disciplined convex programming framework, is that we can use softwares like CVXPY or MOSEK to model this portfolio optimization problems. EVaR and EDaR are implemented in the python package Riskfolio-Lib.",
  "Kanak Vrindavan\n\nKanak Vrindavan is a garden in Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan. It is built in a valley surrounded by Aravali hills and is located on the way to the Amer Fort at the bottom of the Nahargarh hill. The place is approx 8 km north of the Jaipur city. The garden complex is having many nearby tourist attractions as the Amer fort Palace, Jaigarh fort and Nahargarh fort along with much lush greenery. The garden was coined by Kachchwaha Rajput Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh of Jaipur, approximately 275 years ago, at the time when the complex was built. It includes term 'Vrindavan' as the garden resembles the descriptions of the place, where God Sri Krishna had performed MahaRaas near Mathura, and word Kanak came from Maharaja's one of the Maharani Kanakde. This garden is compared to the valley of Vrindavan and the maharaja, consecrated an idol of Sri Krishna in a temple in the Kanak Vrindavan valley called the Shri Govind Deoji Parisar. The garden has a temple, a series of fountains and intricate marble decorations. It is managed by the Government of Rajasthan.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Kanak Vrindavan Valley Complex was built approximately 275 years ago by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh of Jaipur. This beautiful, greenery filled valley is surrounded by the Aravalli hills and often said to resemble the Vrindavan; the place where Lord Krishna enjoyed the Maharaas with Gopis. The Kanak Vrindavan Valley was built for entertainment and recreation of Maharani and the Maharaja. According to some people the Maharaja planned for an Ashvamedha Yagna and made arrangement of waters from sacred rivers to collect here. A Lord Krishna Temple named Govind Deoji was also built around the same time.\n\nArchitecture\n\nThe Kanak Vrindavan Garden is a beautifully constructed and chosen spot located in the valley of the Nahargarh hills, and is dotted with unique trees. It is full of trees and lawns, decorated with intricate 'chhatris', exquisite mirror and 'jali' work on the walls of the Govind Deoji temple, along with a support of a series of fountains. The main garden is divided into eight sections, and is having a main fountain called 'Parikrama', carved out of a single marble slab. Temple Garbha Griha is also placed inside the temple parisar (complex) and is decorated with delicate 'panni' work. These all season green gardens at the Valley offer a good view of Jaipur and other nearby attractions mainly Amer Fort and the Dharbawati River. The scenery has been used a number of times in many Bollywood films, such as Lamhe (1991). Some nearby attractions include: Amer Fort, Jal Mahal, Elephant Park, Nahargarh fort and Jaigarh Fort.",

  "Oman national cricket team\n\nThe Oman national cricket team is the team that represents the country of Oman and is governed by the Oman Cricket Board, which became an Affiliate Member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2000, and gained Associate status in 2014. The national side has played matches at Twenty20 International level. On 24 April 2019, Oman achieved One-Day International status for the first time until 2023, after they beat tournament hosts Namibia by four wickets in 2019 ICC World Cricket League Division Two.\n\nOman's first competitive matches came at the 2002 ACC Trophy, and the side has since participated in many Asian Cricket Council tournaments, finishing runner-up in the 2004 ACC Trophy and twice winning the ACC Twenty20 Cup. Oman has participated in ICC World Cup Qualifier without qualifying for the final tournament, placing ninth at the 2005 ICC Trophy and eleventh at the 2009 World Cup Qualifier. In July 2015, with their win against Namibia in the 2015 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier, Oman gained Twenty20 International status and qualified for 2016 ICC World Twenty20 in India, its first major international tournament\n\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Oman and other ICC Members after 1 January 2019 will be a full T20I.\n\nMost cricket in Oman is played by expatriate Indians and Pakistanis (and their descendants), rather than by native Omanis \u2013 in 2010, only 100 of the 780 players in the national league were Arabs, or around 13 percent. The composition of the Omani national side has generally reflected this, although several Arabs have appeared for the team. Quotas of Arab players have been introduced for both club teams and the national side, in order to boost cricket's popularity amongst the Arab population.\n\nCompared to other Associate nations, Oman have been incredibly consistent and the quickest team in terms of rise in performance. The team had been participating in Division 5, against small teams like Tanzania, Nigeria just in 2016. They had also only become an associate member in 2014. But in just 4 years they have become an established ODI nation, and one of the strongest associate teams in cricket. They have also established themselves in T20Is, won through all divisions and participated in a World T20. It is an incredible achievement of doing all these difficult things in such a small span of time.\n\nEarly years and ICC Membership\n\nOman became an affiliate member of the ICC in 2000. Their senior international debut came at the 2002 ACC Trophy where they failed to progress beyond the first round, with their only win coming against Qatar. A huge improvement was shown in the 2004 tournament when they reached the final, where they lost against the United Arab Emirates. This qualified them for the 2005 ICC Trophy, the final qualification stage for the 2007 World Cup. It also qualified them for the Asia Cup in 2006. Later in 2004, they won the Middle East Cup after a tied game against Bahrain. They won the tournament as they beat Bahrain in the group stage. In the 2014 ACC Premier League in Malaysia they reached 4th place with three wins.\n\n2005 ICC Trophy and aftermath\n\nIn 2005, Oman became the first affiliate member of the ICC to compete in the ICC Trophy. Despite being the mystery men of the tournament, they lost all their group games, but then won their play-off games against Uganda and the USA, the latter when they successfully chased down a mammoth target of 345, featuring an unbroken 127-run partnership for the eighth wicket. This gave them ninth place out of the twelve teams in the competition, enough to earn a place in Division Two of the ICC World Cricket League in 2007.\n\n2006 saw a drop in form for Oman, as they were eliminated in the first round of the ACC Trophy, with their only win coming against the Maldives. As mentioned above, they were originally scheduled to participate in the Asia Cup in 2006, playing their first ODIs against Pakistan and India. However this tournament was postponed until 2008, and the ACC decided to use the 2006 ACC Trophy as a qualification tournament, meaning that Oman's place was taken by Hong Kong.\n\n2007\u20132013\n\nIn October/November 2007, Oman took part in the inaugural ACC Twenty20 Cup held in Kuwait, where they played in Group A against; Afghanistan, Malaysia, Nepal and Qatar. Oman finished in the top two of their group and qualified for the semi-final stage. Oman beat Kuwait in their semi-final, then shared the tournament after the final match against Afghanistan was tied.\n\nIn November 2007, Oman travelled to Namibia to take part in Division Two of the ICC World Cricket League. They played Denmark, the hosts and the UAE in addition to the two qualifiers from Division Three; Uganda and Argentina. Although Oman won all their group matches, they lost to the UAE in the final. On the basis of their top four finish in this tournament, Oman qualified for the ICC World Cup Qualifier in 2009, the final tournament in qualification for the 2011 World Cup.\n\nIn January 2009, Oman participated in the ACC Cup, Challenge tournament in Chiang Mai, Thailand. They came first with ease, defeating the Maldives and Bhutan in the Semi finals and finals respectively. The fourth favourites to win the cup were hosts, Thailand who ended up in fourth place.\n\nIn April 2009, Oman travelled to South Africa to participate in the ICC World Cup Qualifier, the final tournament in qualification for the 2011 World Cup. During the tournament Oman finished last in their group and in the 11th place playoff they beat Denmark by 5 wickets.\n\nIn the 2009 ACC Twenty20 Cup, Oman were drawn in Group B. In the group stages of the competition it won all five of its games, finishing top of the group and qualifying for the semi-finals. In the semi-finals it lost to the United Arab Emirates, therefore missing out on a chance to win back-to-back titles. In the third place playoff, it defeated Kuwait. This victory enabled Oman to claim the final qualifying spot for the cricket tournament at the 2010 Asian Games. They played in 2011 ICC World Cricket League Division Three, where they came 3rd to remain in 2013 ICC World Cricket League Division Three.\n\n2014 onwards: Associate Membership and ODI and T20I status\n\nAt the ICC Annual Conference, held in Melbourne, Australia, in June 2014, the Oman Cricket Board was upgraded from an affiliate member of the ICC to an associate member. That announcement came during the 2014 WCL Division Four, where Oman placed fifth to be relegated to the 2016 Division Five event. Despite the team's poor performance in the 50-over format, Oman went on to win its next major international tournament, the 2015 ACC Twenty20 Cup, thus qualifying for 2015 World Twenty20 Qualifier in Ireland and Scotland.\n\nBy defeating Namibia in a sudden-death match at the World Twenty20 Qualifier, Oman reached the top six teams at the tournament, thus qualifying for the 2016 World Twenty20 and gaining Twenty20 International status until at least 2019. The team made its T20I debut in the fifth-place play-off against Afghanistan, and later in the year played bilateral T20I series against Afghanistan, Hong Kong, and United Arab Emirates.\n\nIn 2016 Oman appeared at the 2016 World Twenty20 in India where they recorded an upset victory over Ireland. They also appeared at the 2016 Asia Cup Qualifier.\n\nIn January 2017 Oman took part in the 2017 Desert T20 Challenge. They reached the semi-finals of the tournament by beating Hong Kong in the group stages, before being defeated by Afghanistan.\n\nIn April 2019, Oman gained ODI status for the first time, until at least 2022.\n\nRecords and statistics\n\nInternational match summary \u2014 Oman Last updated 14 June 2022\n\nOne-Day Internationals\n\nMost ODI runs for Oman\n\nMost ODI wickets for Oman\n\nODI record versus other nations\n\n''Records complete to ODI #4410.

  "Faculty of Science, University of Zagreb\n\nFaculty of Science (Prirodoslovno-matemati\u010dki fakultet, abbr: PMF) is a faculty of the University of Zagreb that comprises seven departments - biology, physics, chemistry, mathematics, geophysics, geography and geology. The Faculty has 288 full professors, associate and assistant professors, 180 junior researchers and about 6000 students.\n\nThe Faculty of Science was formally established in 1946, although the teaching of these subjects had existed in the university since 1876. The Faculty offers undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate study programmes, and pursues research in the fields of natural sciences and mathematics. It also encompasses the seismological service, the mareographic and meteorological stations, and the Zagreb Botanical Garden.\n\nThe Faculty of Science is engaged in excellent cooperation with numerous universities and institutes abroad. Professors of the Faculty have been invited as visiting lecturers to European and American universities, and young staff members, as well as postgraduate students, are regularly sent to international universities and institutes for further research.\n\nHistory\n\nOn 23 September 1669. Leopold I certified at the Jesuit Neoacademica Zagrebiensis, a three-year higher education institution, which gradually developed the studies of Philosophy, Law and Theology. At the Jesuit School philosophy was taught even earlier, and part of its first year studies were logic, physics, and metaphysics. Neither Jesuit School (until 1773), nor royal Regia Scientiarum Academica (until 1850) represented a real university. Croatian Parliament and Franz Joseph I of Austria, introduced the Law on founding the University of Zagreb. Soon after the establishing of the University of Zagreb, Faculties of Law, Theology and Philosophy started operating. The Chairs of the Faculty of Philosophy were appointed gradually. In the field of natural sciences the teaching started in 1876, with first lectures in mineralogy and geology, and then in botany, physics, mathematics, chemistry and zoology and geography. Dr. Fran Tu\u0107an (1878 - 1954), a popularizer of science in Croatia, who was also president of Matica hrvatska, was appointed as the first dean of the Faculty of Science.\n\nA long endeavour of the Science Department of the Faculty of Philosophy to attain the status of Faculty, finally materialized in 1946, when the Faculty of Science was established.\n\nDepartments\n\nThe Faculty consists of following departments:\n\nDepartment of Geography\n\nDepartment of Geography at the Faculty of Science in Zagreb is the oldest and the biggest geographic department in Croatia. The Department of Geography consists of three divisions: physical geography, human geography, and regional geography and teaching methods. The Cartographic-technical Centre with a rich Cartographic Collection and the Central Geographic Library are also part of the department. It was founded on 27 December 1883 by Petar Matkovi\u0107. In 1927 Institute for physical geography is being established within the department and twenty years later incorporated in the newly established Faculty of science. Central geographical library was opened in 1910 and, until 1994 it was the only geographical library in Croatia.\n\nProfessor Ivan Crkven\u010di\u0107 launched Geographical papers scientific journal that is still being released, as well as Acta Geographica Croatica.\n\nDepartment of Geophysics\n\nThe Department of Geophysics encompasses three major fields of study: meteorology, oceanography and seismology.\n\nIt also includes the Croatian Seismological Survey, a scientific organization which monitors earthquake activity in Croatia.\n\nStudy programmes\n\nThe Faculty of Science has eight undergraduate study programmes (Bachelor degree) encompassing 3 years of studies (180 credits), 26 graduate study programmes (Master degree) encompassing two years of studies (120 credits) or five years of studies (300 credits) and seven postgraduate study programmes (PhD degree) encompassing 3 years of studies (180 credits). Education is at all levels characterized by teaching and supervision at a high academic level by staff actively involved in research.

  "Repentigny, Quebec\n\nRepentigny is an off-island suburb of Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is located north of the city on the lower end of the L'Assomption River, and on the Saint Lawrence River. Repentigny and Charlemagne were the first towns off the eastern tip of the Island of Montreal. Repentigny is part of the Lanaudi\u00e8re region.\n\nHistory\n\nIt was founded in 1670 by Jean-Baptiste Le Gardeur, son of Seigneur Pierre Le Gardeur. During the town's first 250 years, Repentigny was only inhabited by a few hundred peasants, or habitants, and was an agricultural community. In 1677, the first population census only shows 30 inhabitants. Its first mayor was Benjamin Moreau 1855.\n\nRepentigny merged with its neighbouring city of Le Gardeur on June 1, 2002. The city's area grew from 29 to 69 km2 and the population grew by 70%.\n\nRepentigny was also the western terminus of the Chemin du Roy, a road that extends eastward towards Quebec City.\n\nDemographics\n\nIn the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Repentigny had a population of 86,100 living in 34,174 of its 34,710 total private dwellings, a change of NaN% from its 2016 population of 84,285. With a land area of 61.52 km2, it had a population density of in 2021.\n\nSingle responses: 51.60% of respondents gave a single response of 'Canadian', while a further 17.67% identified with both 'Canadian', and one or more other ancestries. 15.13% of respondents gave a single response of French, 1.86% of respondents gave a single response of Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, 1.37% gave a single response of Italian, 1.34% gave a single response of Irish and 1.27% gave a single response of Haitian.\n\nMultiple responses: Counting both single and multiple responses, the most commonly identified ethnocultural ancestries were:\n\n''Percentages are calculated as a proportion of the total number of respondents and may total more than 100% due to dual responses. All ethnocultural ancestries of more than 1% are listed in the table above according to the exact terminology used by Statistics Canada.\n\nTransit\n\nRepentigny is the central point for transit in South-Central Lanaudi\u00e8re. Its Centre d'\u00c9change Rive Nord-Est (Northeastern Shore Transit Exchange Centre), administrated by R\u00e9seau de transport m\u00e9tropolitain, is the main infrastructure for transit in the region. Unlike a bus terminal, no departures are available from the Centre d'\u00c9change, but transfers from one circuit to the other are possible. 9 of the 10 RTCR de la MRC de L'Assomption transit system circuits travel via Centre d'\u00c9change, in addition to the 2 CRTL regional lines. Thus, Repentigny is directly connected to Terrebonne, Charlemagne, L'Assomption, Montreal, Montr\u00e9al-Est, Saint-Sulpice, Lavaltrie, Lanoraie, Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve-de-Berthier, Berthierville, La Visitation-de-l'\u00cele-Dupas, Saint-Ignace-de-Loyola, Saint-Paul-d'Industrie, Crabtree, Sainte-Marie-Salom\u00e9 and Joliette.\n\nThe city of Repentigny takes part in the L'Assomption MRC public transportation network effort and pan-regional Lanaudi\u00e8re Regional Transport Commission, linking all of the Regional County Municipalities of Lanaudi\u00e8re, even the northmost ones.

  "Bell's palsy\n\nBell's palsy is a type of facial paralysis that results in a temporary inability to control the facial muscles on the affected side of the face. In most cases, the weakness is temporary and significantly improves over weeks. Symptoms can vary from mild to severe. They may include muscle twitching, weakness, or total loss of the ability to move one or, in rare cases, both sides of the face. Other symptoms include drooping of the eyelid, a change in taste, and pain around the ear. Typically symptoms come on over 48 hours. Bell's palsy can trigger an increased sensitivity to sound known as hyperacusis.\n\nThe cause of Bell's palsy is unknown and it can occur in any age. Risk factors include diabetes, a recent upper respiratory tract infection, and pregnancy. It results from a dysfunction of cranial nerve VII (the facial nerve). Many believe that this is due to a viral infection that results in swelling. Diagnosis is based on a person's appearance and ruling out other possible causes. Other conditions that can cause facial weakness include brain tumor, stroke, Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2, myasthenia gravis, and Lyme disease.\n\nThe condition normally gets better by itself, with most achieving normal or near-normal function. Corticosteroids have been found to improve outcomes, while antiviral medications may be of a small additional benefit. The eye should be protected from drying up with the use of eye drops or an eyepatch. Surgery is generally not recommended. Often signs of improvement begin within 14 days, with complete recovery within six months. A few may not recover completely or have a recurrence of symptoms.\n\nBell's palsy is the most common cause of one-sided facial nerve paralysis (70%). It occurs in 1 to 4 per 10,000 people per year. About 1.5% of people are affected at some point in their lives. It most commonly occurs in people between ages 15 and 60. Males and females are affected equally. It is named after Scottish surgeon Charles Bell (1774\u20131842), who first described the connection of the facial nerve to the condition.\n\nSigns and symptoms\n\nBell's palsy is characterized by a one-sided facial droop that comes on within 72 hours. In rare cases (<1%), it can occur on both sides resulting in total facial paralysis.\n\nThe facial nerve controls a number of functions, such as blinking and closing the eyes, smiling, frowning, lacrimation, salivation, flaring nostrils and raising eyebrows. It also carries taste sensations from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, through the chorda tympani nerve (a branch of the facial nerve). Because of this, people with Bell's palsy may present with loss of taste sensation in the anterior 2\u20443 of the tongue on the affected side.\n\nAlthough the facial nerve innervates the stapedius muscle of the middle ear (through the tympanic branch), sound sensitivity, causing normal sounds to be perceived as very loud (hyperacusis), and dysacusis are possible but hardly ever clinically evident.\n\nAlthough defined as a mononeuritis (involving only one nerve), people diagnosed with Bell's palsy may have \"myriad neurological symptoms\" including \"facial tingling, moderate or severe headache/neck pain, memory problems, balance problems, ipsilateral limb paresthesias, ipsilateral limb weakness, and a sense of clumsiness\" that are \"unexplained by facial nerve dysfunction\".\n\nCause\n\nThe cause of Bell's palsy is unknown. Risk factors include diabetes, a recent upper respiratory tract infection, and pregnancy.\n\nSome viruses are thought to establish a persistent (or latent) infection without symptoms, e.g., the varicella zoster virus and the Epstein\u2013Barr virus, both of the herpes family. Reactivation of an existing (dormant) viral infection has been suggested as a cause of acute Bell's palsy. As the facial nerve swells and becomes inflamed in reaction to the infection, it causes pressure within the Fallopian canal, resulting in the restriction of blood and oxygen to the nerve cells. Other viruses and bacteria that have been linked to the development of Bell's palsy include HIV, sarcoidosis and Lyme Disease. This new activation could be triggered by trauma, environmental factors, and metabolic or emotional disorders.\n\nFamilial inheritance has been found in 4\u201314% of cases. There may also be an association with migraines.\n\nIn December 2020, the U.S. FDA recommended that recipients of the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines should be monitored for symptoms of Bell's palsy after several cases were reported among clinical trial participants, though the data were not sufficient to determine a causal link.\n\nGenetics\n\nA meta-analysis of genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified the first unequivocal association with Bell's palsy.\n\nPathophysiology\n\nBell's palsy is the result of a malfunction of the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII), which controls the muscles of the face. Facial palsy is typified by inability to move the muscles of facial expression. The paralysis is of the infranuclear/lower motor neuron type.\n\nIt is thought that as a result of inflammation of the facial nerve, pressure is produced on the nerve where it exits the skull within its bony canal (the stylomastoid foramen), blocking the transmission of neural signals or damaging the nerve. Patients with facial palsy for which an underlying cause can be found are not considered to have Bell's palsy per se. Possible causes of facial paralysis include tumor, meningitis, stroke, diabetes mellitus, head trauma and inflammatory diseases of the cranial nerves (sarcoidosis, brucellosis, etc.). In these conditions, the neurologic findings are rarely restricted to the facial nerve. Babies can be born with facial palsy. In a few cases, bilateral facial palsy has been associated with acute HIV infection.\n\nIn some research, the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) has been identified in a majority of cases diagnosed as Bell's palsy through endoneurial fluid sampling. Other research, however, identified, out of a total of 176 cases diagnosed as Bell's palsy, HSV-1 in 31 cases (18%) and herpes zoster in 45 cases (26%).\n\nIn addition, HSV-1 infection is associated with demyelination of nerves. This nerve damage mechanism is different from the above-mentioned\u2014that edema, swelling and compression of the nerve in the narrow bone canal is responsible for nerve damage. Demyelination may not even be directly caused by the virus, but by an unknown immune response.\n\nDiagnosis\n\nBell's palsy is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it is diagnosed by elimination of other reasonable possibilities. By definition, no specific cause can be determined. There are no routine lab or imaging tests required to make the diagnosis. The degree of nerve damage can be assessed using the House-Brackmann score.\n\nOne study found that 45% of patients are not referred to a specialist, which suggests that Bell's palsy is considered by physicians to be a straightforward diagnosis that is easy to manage.\n\nOther conditions that can cause similar symptoms include herpes zoster, Lyme disease, sarcoidosis, stroke, and brain tumors.\n\nDifferential diagnosis\n\nOnce the facial paralysis sets in, many people may mistake it as a symptom of a stroke; however, there are a few subtle differences. A stroke will usually cause a few additional symptoms, such as numbness or weakness in the arms and legs. And unlike Bell's palsy, a stroke will usually let patients control the upper part of their faces. A person with a stroke will usually have some wrinkling of their forehead.\n\nIn areas where Lyme disease is common, it accounts for about 25% of cases of facial palsy. In the U.S., Lyme is most common in the New England and Mid-Atlantic states and parts of Wisconsin and Minnesota. The first sign of about 80% of Lyme infections, typically one or two weeks after a tick bite, is usually an expanding rash that may be accompanied by headaches, body aches, fatigue, or fever. In up to 10\u201315% of Lyme infections, facial palsy appears several weeks later, and may be the first sign of infection that is noticed as the Lyme rash typically does not itch and is not painful. The likelihood that the facial palsy is caused by Lyme disease should be estimated, based on recent history of outdoor activities in likely tick habitats during warmer months, recent history of rash or symptoms such as headache and fever, and whether the palsy affects both sides of the face (much more common in Lyme than in Bell's palsy). If that likelihood is more than negligible, a serological test for Lyme disease should be performed, and if it exceeds 10%, empiric therapy with antibiotics should be initiated, without corticosteroids, and reevaluated upon completion of laboratory tests for Lyme disease. Corticosteroids have been found to harm outcomes for facial palsy caused by Lyme disease.\n\nOne disease that may be difficult to exclude in the differential diagnosis is involvement of the facial nerve in infections with the herpes zoster virus. The major differences in this condition are the presence of small blisters, or vesicles, on the external ear, significant pain in the jaw, ear face, and/or neck and hearing disturbances, but these findings may occasionally be lacking (zoster sine herpete). Reactivation of existing herpes zoster infection leading to facial paralysis in a Bell's palsy type pattern is known as Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2. The prognosis for Bell's palsy patients is generally much better than for Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2 patients.\n",

  "Mark Scott (cricketer)\n\nMark Stephen Scott (born 10 March 1959 in Muswell Hill, Middlesex) is a former English first-class cricketer who played county cricket for Worcestershire in the early 1980s.\n\nScott appeared on a number of occasions for the Second XIs of Middlesex and Glamorgan between 1977 and 1980 before moving to Worcestershire, for whom he made his first-class debut in June 1981 against Surrey at The Oval. Opening the batting, Scott made 46 and 52, and retained his place for much of the rest of the season thanks to some solid scores including what was to prove his only first-class century, 109 against Gloucestershire in mid-July. He finished the 1981 season with 968 first-class runs at 26.08, including that hundred and six further half-centuries though his one-day form was less impressive as his top score was only 42.\n\nScott began the 1982 season fairly well established in the Worcestershire side, but a succession of low scores saw him play only occasionally from mid-season onwards. In 1983 he forced his way back into the first team, but again did poorly, making a pair against Nottinghamshire in July in what turned out to be his penultimate first-class match (he made 23 and 21 in his last, against Essex in late August).\n\nScott left Worcestershire for Sussex in 1984, and remained for 1985 as well, but never played a first-team game for that county and after a year out of county cricket he returned to New Road in 1987 to begin an unusual final chapter of his Worcestershire career. He never played first-team cricket for the county again, but for six seasons he captained the Second XI, often coming in at the bottom of the order despite his batting ability. Against Hampshire II in 1991 he made 2 from number 11 in the first innings, then when Worcestershire followed on he opened the batting and hit 181! He amassed 61 not outs from 94 innings during these years in the seconds.\n\nIn 1993 Scott was part of the victorious Old Hill team which beat local rivals West Bromwich Dartmouth in the final of the Abbot Ale National Club Championship at Lord's, and six years later he made one final List A appearance for the Worcestershire Cricket Board XI against Hampshire Cricket Board in the NatWest Trophy.\n\nScott is one of very few Level 4 cricket coaches in the world and is now coaching the Gresham's School First XI cricket team in Holt, a small town in Norfolk, England.

  "2013 Tucapel\n\n2013 Tucapel, provisional designation, is an eccentric Florian asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 11 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 22 October 1971, by the University of Chile's National Astronomical Observatory at Cerro El Roble Astronomical Station. It was named for one of the indigenous Mapuche chiefs.\n\nOrbit and classification\n\nTucapel is a member of the Flora family, one of the largest groups of stony asteroids. It orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 1.8\u20132.8 AU once every 3 years and 6 months (1,265 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.23 and an inclination of 8\u00b0 with respect to the ecliptic.\n\nIt was first observed as at Johannesburg Observatory in 1936. Its first used observation was taken at Turku Observatory in 1942, when it was identified as, thereby extending the body's observation arc by 29 years prior to its official discovery observation at Cerro El Roble.\n\nPhysical characteristics\n\nTucapel has been characterized as a common S-type asteroid.\n\nRotation period\n\nIn October 2009, a rotational lightcurve of Tucapel was obtained from photometric observations at the Oakley Southern Sky Observatory (E09) in Australia. Lightcurve analysis gave a well-defined rotation period of 9.028 hours with a brightness variation of 0.34 magnitude (U=3).\n\nDiameter and albedo\n\nAccording to the surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite and NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Tucapel measures between 10.61 and 12.685 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.1003 and 0.328. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.24 \u2014 derived from 8 Flora, the family's largest member and namesake \u2013 and calculates a diameter of 11.84 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 11.8.\n\nNaming\n\nThis minor planet was named for one of the brave chiefs of the Mapuche, indigenous inhabitants of south-central Chile and southwestern Argentina, who, with his wife Gualeva, victoriously entered the city of Imperial. He died in 1560, fighting against the colonial Spaniards (also see Arauco War, Battle of Tucapel and Lautaro).

  "Baseline Road (Colorado)\n\nBaseline Road is a major east-west street in Boulder, Colorado that extends east of the city through parts of four counties. The western terminus of Baseline Road is at Flagstaff Mountain in the City of Boulder Mountain Parks. The eastern terminus is at 16800 Watkins Road, about 6 mi east of Lochbuie on the boundary between Adams and Weld Counties. The total length of Baseline Road is approximately 38 mi, all of which is within the Denver-Aurora-Boulder Combined Statistical Area in Colorado. Baseline Road runs almost exactly along the 40th line of latitude.\n\nOrigin of the name\n\nOn May 30, 1854, the Kansas-Nebraska Act created the Kansas Territory and the Nebraska Territory, divided by the 40th parallel north. The Pike's Peak Gold Rush of 1858-1861 lured thousands of gold seekers into the goldfields of the northwestern Kansas Territory and the southwestern Nebraska Territory. On February 28, 1861, the western portion of the Kansas Territory and the southwestern portion of the Nebraska Territory were incorporated into the new Colorado Territory. The 40th parallel became the primary baseline for surveying the land in the eastern portion of the new territory, and a road was eventually cut along the survey baseline.\n\nOfficial names for the road\n\nThe road along the 40th parallel is officially named Baseline Road in Boulder County and the City and County of Broomfield, 168th Avenue in Adams County, and County Line Road or Weld County Road 2 in Weld County.\n\nA 7 mi stretch of Baseline Road, from US 287 in Lafayette to I-25 in Broomfield, is part of State Highway 7.\n\nDescription\n\nBaseline Road descends from Flagstaff Mountain (site of the 1935 CCC Sunrise Amphitheatre) and runs through the city of Boulder for its first four miles (6 km). Within Boulder, it passes the Colorado Chautauqua, a National Historic Landmark, near 9th Street; crosses State Highway 93 (Broadway); then passes the University of Colorado Law School just east of Broadway. The road then crosses US 36 (28th Street), passes the Williams Village dormitory towers of the University of Colorado, and crosses State Highway 157 (Foothills Parkway). East of 55th Street, the road seems to terminate at Cherryvale Road. It actually continues, shifted slightly to the north, following a small northbound stretch of Cherryvale. Thereafter, the road leaves the city of Boulder and takes on a more rural character until approaching State Highway 42 (95th Street). At that point the more urban surroundings of Lafayette are evident, and the next two miles (3 km) run through the heart of Lafayette, including the road junction with US 287 (N. 107th St.).\n\nAbout one mile (1.6 km) beyond the eastern city limits of Lafayette, the road crosses the eastern boundary of Boulder County and passes the Erie Municipal Airport. For two miles (3 km) beyond this point, Baseline Road forms the boundary between Weld County and the City and County of Broomfield. For the next two miles (3 km), from Sheridan Parkway to the interchange with I-25, the road passes through a rural northern portion of the City and County of Broomfield.\n\nJust east of I-25, the road abuts a commercial area in the extreme northern part of the city of Thornton. For the next mile, from this point to York Street, Baseline Road marks the boundary between Adams County and the City and County of Broomfield. From York Street east, the road forms the boundary between Adams County and Weld County for the remainder of its length.\n\nEast of York Street, about 10 mi of rural road ensue, until Brighton is entered near US 85. Baseline Road passes through the northern part of Brighton for about five miles (8 km), eventually reaching the town of Lochbuie and the interchange with I-76. Beyond I-76 the road once again takes on a rural character and continues to its eastern terminus at 16800 Watkins Road.",

It reaffirmed the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter and was aware of the consequences of conflict on relations between countries and the humanitarian situation in the affected countries. The council stressed the underlining political, economic, humanitarian and moral advantages in preventing armed conflict.\n\nIt recognised the importance of addressing the root causes of armed conflict and the important role of the United Nations. There was concern at the destabilising effect of illicit arms trafficking and therefore it was important in raising awareness of international humanitarian law. The council also reiterated that preventive and post-conflict measures were part of a comprehensive conflict prevention strategy.\n\nActs\n\nThe resolution stressed that the primary responsibility for conflict prevention was upon national governments. According to the council, the success of a preventive strategy from the United Nations required support and consent of the government concerned. It expressed willingness to consider armed conflicts brought to the attention of the council by any Member State. All Member States were called upon to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace and security and provide resources towards conflict prevention. At the same time, it reaffirmed the importance of the peaceful settlement of conflicts in accordance with Chapter VI of the United Nations Charter.\n\nThe security council invited the secretary-general to refer cases of violations of international humanitarian law and potential conflict situations to the council. It stressed the importance of the inclusion of civilian police and disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration components within peacekeeping operations. The secretary-general was asked to pay greater attention to gender perspectives during peacekeeping mandates.\n\nIt supported the increased use of fact-finding and confidence-building missions to regions of conflict in developing regional prevention strategies.

  "Cave World\n\nCave World is the third studio album by Swedish post-punk band Viagra Boys. It was released on 8 July 2022, through Year0001.\n\nBackground and recording\n\nCave World was written during the COVID-19 lockdowns, which serves a basis for much of the album, particularly with songs referring to hesitancy to COVID-19 vaccines. The album also was influenced by the origin of humans during the Paleolithic era (particularly cavemen), conspiracy theories, especially conspiracy theories and misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and QAnon supporters. Recording took place in winter 2021\u201322, during a break in touring in support of their previous album, Welfare Jazz.\n\nMusic and composition\n\nThe album's music style was described by Ross Horton of The Line of Best Fit as a \"heady brew of trad punk, post-punk, country and new wave and their look is a combination of unlicensed doorman menace and tracksuit couch slacker\". Mark Tremblay described the album as a fusion of post-punk and new rave, and described some of the tracks as venturing into electronica.\n\n\"Big Boy\" includes a guest appearance from Jason Williamson, vocalist of English band Sleaford Mods.\n\nCritical reception\n\nCave World was critically acclaimed by contemporary music critics upon release. On review aggregator website, Metacritic, Cave World has an average critic score of 81 out of 100, indicating \"universal acclaim\" based on seven critics. On AnyDecentMusic?, Cave World has an average score of 8.1 out of 10 based on ten contemporary music critic scores.\n\nAlan Ashton-Smith of musicOMH awarded Cave World four-and-a-half stars out of five, summarizing the album as the best album of their career. Ashton-Smith described Cave World as \"clever but debauched, silly but serious, this is the best album of their career thus far\". Ross Horton, writing for The Line of Best Fit gave Cave World a 9 out of 10. Horton compared the album to the works of Iggy Pop and said that the album \"is by some measure their most adventurous. Where the first (2018's Street Worms) was a note-perfect, hermetically-sealed recreation of old thrills, and the second (2021's Welfare Jazz) was an expansive and expanded take on the same source material, this one draws from a new well\".\n\nIan Winwood, writing for Kerrang! gave Cave World four out of five stars, saying \"Cave World is an album brimming not just with colour and life, but also with a sense of striking unease that is pitched somewhere between the deeply sexual and the profoundly sinister.\" Winwood gave specific praise to the tracks \"Ain't No Thief\", \"Return to Monke\", and \"Creepy Crawlers\". Laveia Thomas, of Clash praised the instrumentation on Cave World, particularly the use of the saxophone throughout the album. Thomas said that Cave World \"paints rock'n'roll through a rose-tinted glass \u2013 distorted, warped and just completely fascinating\". Thomas would go further to say that the band \"have built their acclaim on the prefix that they're doing things differently, having built an army of fans from their projects, Viagra Boys weave in hints of electronica, intense bursts of sax, and angsty spoken-word vocals across this soaring new album\".\n\nP.J. McCormick, writing for Pitchfork offered a more mixed review of the album, giving it a 6.2 out of 10. Comparing their work to fellow Swedish band, The Hives, McCormick praised the production of the album saying that the album \"production is cleaner than Viagra Boys\u2019 first two albums, bringing their ever-present drive to the fore. The interplay of the rhythm section, vocal layering, and the occasional sax tear elides some of the weaker lyrics, and the album\u2019s bass-forward gloss recalls Danger Mouse's back catalog of rock-oriented production work (Parquet Courts\u2019 Wide Awake, The Black Keys' El Camino, Portugal. The Man's Woodstock). However, McCormick was critical of the album's critique of the alt-right, particularly saying \"try as they might to curry offense by embodying the mindset of the alt-right internet troll, Cave World\u2019s weaker moments recall a late-night television monologue: toothless, expendable, and not particularly interested in convincing the uninitiated.\"\n\nPersonnel\n\nMusicians\n\nProduction",

The Constance Howard Gallery, part of Goldsmiths, University of London, is named in her honour.\n\nBiography\n\nHoward was born in Abington in Northampton to Mildred Annie Abbott and Arthur Howard, a school teacher. From the age of ten she began taking weekly classes at the Northampton School of Art and subsequently won a scholarship that allowed her to attend full-time when she turned 14. From 1931 Howard was a student at the Royal College of Art in London where she was taught by both Eric Ravilious and Edward Bawden. After graduating in 1935, Howard taught at the Cardiff School of Art where she established a course in dress design. During World War II she taught at the Kingston School of Art where she and her students embroidered maps for the RAF. In December 1945 Howard married the sculptor Harold Wilson Parker and gave up teaching but began exhibiting with the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society.\n\nHoward returned to teaching in 1947 on a part-time basis with embroidery classes at Goldsmiths in south east London. In 1950 Howard designed a large textile hanging for the country pavilion of the Festival of Britain exhibition in London. The Country Wife was completed by Howard and her students, who included Mary Quant, and depicted the activities of the National Federation of Women's Institutes.

She started her career in journalism, working at People magazine and InStyle, and was editor-in-chief at Us Weekly from 2002 to 2009. As an executive, she revamped entertainment industry publications The Hollywood Reporter and Billboard.\n\nEarly life\n\nJanice Min, the youngest of three children, was born in Atlanta, to Nungsun Min, an IRS agent, and Hong Min, a zoology professor turned businessman. Her father taught at the University of Georgia and later became an executive for a medical supply company. Min's parents emigrated to the United States from Seoul, South Korea.\n\nMin grew up mostly in Littleton, Colorado, where her family moved just before she started first grade. She excelled in school, skipping third grade and graduating high school at age 16. As a child, Min was a fan of journalist Connie Chung. Min said her parents were \"oddly permissive\" of her interest in journalism for Asian-American immigrants. Min also had an interest in fashion, ever since she was a little girl.\n\nWhen Min was 13, she lied about her age, saying she was 14, to get a job at McDonald's. In middle school and at Heritage High School, she contributed to the schools' student newspapers. Min worked at a clothing store in a local mall, became a cashier at Target, and sold cosmetics at Foley's during a summer break in college. She interned one summer at MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour.\n\nMin moved to New York City to attend Columbia University when she was 16. There she met her future husband, Peter Sheehy, and graduated in 1990 with a degree in history. She also obtained a master's degree in journalism from the same university.\n\nEarly work\n\nMin began her journalism career in 1991 as a reporter for The Reporter-Dispatch in Westchester County, New York. She covered the crime beat, as well as local school board and planning committee meetings, among other topics.\n\nMin joined People magazine in 1993 as a staff writer. She did not have an interest in celebrity gossip, but was looking for a job and had a friend that worked there. At first, Min struggled at People. According to one of her former coworkers, she was a \"poor writer\". Paula Chin, then-senior editor of the magazine, mentored her. Min became better suited for the position as People began to focus on lighter stories. She covered fashion for the \"Style Watch\" section, which became a regular weekly feature. Min was promoted to senior editor in 1997.\n\nAfter five years at People, Min left the paper and briefly joined Life Magazine as the assistant managing editor. According to Adweek, she was \"bored and miserable\" at Life, because of the slower pace of a monthly publication. Min left in 1998, after less than a year at Life, to work for InStyle under the same job title. There she led the development of InStyle Weddings and InStyle Makeover. In 2001, Min quit InStyle and started looking for another position.\n\nUs Weekly\n\nIn 2002, Min applied for the editor-in-chief position at Us Weekly and was instead hired as an executive editor under Bonnie Fuller, who became editor-in-chief. The following July, Fuller resigned and Min was appointed to take her place.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, Min turned Us Weekly into one of the magazine industry's \"major success stories\". Public interest in celebrity news was growing, as was the magazine's circulation. In her role at Us Weekly, Min had a significant impact on popular culture and was influential in creating an industry for celebrity gossip. For example, Us Weekly was largely responsible for the popularity of the reality TV show about a couple with eight children, Jon & Kate Plus 8, after it featured John and Kate on the cover of eight sequential issues. Min focused much of the publication's editorial on reality TV stars, rather than actors and singers. According to Adweek, Min positioned celebrities as the reader's friend who \"can take a little good-natured ribbing\" and fostered more cooperative relationships with celebrities. According to Elle, Min depicted celebrities as people that \"may make dumb, even craven, moves, but are never villains\". According to The Los Angeles Times, Min \"softened the tone and made it much more friendly to stars\". Min also created a calmer environment in the workplace, which had previously been dramatic and contentious. Under Min's tenure, the publication's circulation grew from 800,000 copies per week in 2000 to 1.9 million by 2009.\n\nMin had negotiated a contract that partially tied her compensation to the number of magazines sold. As distribution increased, her salary peaked at $2 million a year. She left in August 2009 as her contract was up for renewal and ad revenues at the publication were decreasing. For her work at Us Weekly, Min was named AdWeek magazine's Editor of the Year. While in-between jobs, Min received job offers from women's magazines, but was not interested. She spent ten months with her family.\n\nMin was influential in creating an interest in celebrity pregnancies in popular culture through her work at Us Weekly. Shortly after she left, Min got a deal with St. James Press to write a book, How to Look Hot in a Minivan: A Real Woman's Guide to Losing Weight, Looking Great, and Dressing Chic in the Age of the Celebrity Mom. In August 2012, she wrote a column in The New York Times complaining about unrealistic weight and beauty expectations for new moms, set by celebrities. She was criticized in blogs and social media for criticizing an aspect of popular culture she helped establish. Min said the magazine was responding to reader interests, not creating them.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter and Billboard\n\nIn December 2009, the CEO of Prometheus Global Media, Richard Beckman, acquired The Hollywood Reporter. According to The Daily Beast, The Hollywood Reporter was \"in a death spiral\". It had become too friendly to the celebrities it covered and was losing readership to competitor Daily Variety. After seeing in The New York Post that Min was moving to Los Angeles, Beckman began courting her to lead the publication's turnaround. She was named editorial director of The Hollywood Reporter in May 2010.\n\nFour months after Min took the position, The Hollywood Reporter was re-launched as a weekly, glossy magazine. She focused the publication's editorial on in-depth feature stories and visuals. According to The New York Times, \"she published 3,000-word profiles of and about Hollywood, plus plenty of juicy photo galleries and lighter items\" as opposed to \"quick blurbs about comings and goings\". She avoided the re-written press releases and industry jargon that were common in prior issues. Some of the subjects upon which she focused included box office numbers, controversies, fashion and personal celebrity news. Min created art and photography departments and hired more journalists. The publication also began hosting Oscar and Emmy award parties for nominees.\n\nMin led the modernization of the publication's website as well. The Hollywood Reporter web traffic increased 800 percent under her tenure at the publication and revenue increased 50 percent.\n\nIn January 2014, Min was promoted to co-president/chief creative officer of the Entertainment Group of Guggenheim Media. In this role she became the head of both The Hollywood Reporter and Billboard. Billboard was still considered the most reputable magazine in the music industry, but it was losing readers and writers due to a tumult in the music industry. Min was appointed to lead a similar turnaround as the one she facilitated at The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nQuibi\n\nIn 2018, Janice Min joined Quibi, Jeffrey Katzenberg's video startup business, to lead its daily news shows rubric called Daily Essentials. In September 2019, Min exited Quibi, ahead of its April 2020 launch.\n\nAnkler Media\n\nIn 2021, Min collaborated with Richard Rushfield to launch Ankler Media, which expanded the Substack newsletter focused on entertainment news called The Ankler into a larger media business to include podcasts and events, also covering the entertainment business. Min currently serves as co-owner, CEO, and Editor in Chief of Ankler Media.\n\nMin and Rushfield took part in an incubator program for this venture through Y Combinator to raise seed capital in June, 2022.\n\nPersonal life\n\nJanice Min currently resides in Los Angeles, with her husband, Peter Sheehy, who is director of a nonprofit organization called KidUnity and a history teacher at Harvard-Westlake School. They have three children - Lila, Tate and Will. In 2019, it was reported that Min purchased an $8 million mansion located in Brentwood, Los Angeles. She previously bought two properties in the Pacific Palisades in 2010 and 2017 respectively.",

  "Shamkir minaret\n\nThe Shamkir minaret, or the Shamkir tower, also known as the \u201cShamkhor pillar\u201d, is a tower or minaret located near Shamkir (now a city in Azerbaijan). The view of the tower built at the end of the 11th century is known from the detailed written description of N. Florovsky, who visited the medieval settlement of Shamkir in the first half of the 19th century, as well as from the paintings of such artists as Grigory Gagarin and Dubois de Montpereux.\n\nTower details\n\nThe monument attracted the attention of many travelers and was repeatedly mentioned and even described. The earliest reference of the monument is found in Abulfeda (the beginning of the 14th century), noting that the minaret is very high and outstanding. Referring to thestylistic features of its architecture, Mikael Useynov and Leonid Brittanytsky dated the minaret since the 12th to the beginning of the 13th century. G. Gamba, in the description of his travel across the Caucasus, compared the tower with Trajans Column in Rome and noted that the mullahs used the tower to call Muslims to prayer. Eduard Eichwald saw the minaret in 1826, but when Boris Dorn visited the area of the Shamkir settlement in 1861 found only its ruins and reported about its destruction to the ground. The minaret is known for the complementary drawings of Dubois de Montpereux and Grigory Gagarin. However, these drawings do not give the idea of its past surroundings. Therefore, the account of Arseny Sukhanov, who passed through Shamkir in the 1650s, is especially interesting. He wrote that he \"passed through the empty city, it was great, made of brick and a stone from the soil, but inside there was another; both with damaged walls, but only the high minaret made of brick was intact; there was a brick bridge across the river; a great river, divided into five rivers; along the river bank; having crossed that river, on the shore we spent the night against the empty hail of that\u201d.\n\nThe tower was mentioned by the American Protestant missionary Eli Smith: \"The east wind, even after the fog of the morning had subsided, had seemed all day surcharged with noxious vapours; and before reaching the Shamkhor column, I felt the signs of theapproaching fever. We stopped a moment to examine that antiquities. It is built of brick, has spiral stairs within to its top, and is said to be 180 feet in height. On a stone at the base there is an inscription in Arabic script, while another encircles in the upper part, where there is also a surrounded gallery with a door that opens from within. Its origin is unknown, but, apparently, it was built as a mosque\u2019s minaret. The other ruins of the place are the foundations of a large caravanserai, and several small Muslim tombs.\"\n\nThe representation of the monument given by N. Frolovskys is detailed described in his \"Review of the Russian Possessions in the Caucasus published in 1836, considering that \u201cthe most noteworthy of all the monuments there (meaning the Elisavetpol area) is the Shamkhor Pillar, built among the plains on the left bank of the Shamkhor river, 25 versts from the city, and open to the gaze of almost 30 versts. It is surrounded by the ruins of a fortress and other buildings, which were led round by a square wall that stretched a hundred fathoms from north to south, and sixty fathoms across. The time of the pillars construction is unknown, however, an unaccountable story attributes it to Alexander the Great. The base of the column represents a cubic figure and has seven arshins in diameter and six and a quarter in height; on this basis, another pedestal of the same figure is arranged containing six arshins in width, five arshins in height. A round column rises on it, which has a diameter at the base of five, and at the top up to four arshins, eighteen fathoms in height, with a base of up to twenty-two fathoms. The upper part of it is surrounded by a quadrangular cornice, each side enclose 5 yards; under the cornice there is an inscription, believed to be in the Kufic language. Above this cornice, there is still a round column, six fathoms high, which has already collapsed at the top; its diameter at the base is not more than one fathom. The entire pillar has a height of up to 28 yards. In the middle of the column there is a spiral staircase consisting of 124, large and almost destroyed, steps, which are very difficult to climb. In the upper part, under the cornice, there was also a staircase, judging by the indentations in the wall, into which the steps were probably fortified. The pillar is built of bricks on dry matter mixed with sand and small stones; the work is extremely durable and beautiful; the cement is so strong that it has completely merged with the brick. It is impossible without regret to see that time is already beginning, in many places, to destroy this beautiful monument of antiquity, and even the inclination of the pillar is quite noticeable [\u201cIt is doubtful that this column served as an observatory, as Gamba believes (Voyages dans la Russie meridionale etc.), and very likely that it was nothing more than a minaret, from the top of which Muslims were called to prayer\u201c]\u201d\n\nArchitecture\n\nThe minarets design is common. The base is a prismatic volume with an inlet opening. The wedge-shaped bevels create a transition to an octahedral space, on which the slightly thinning tower of the minaret rises. The interpretation of the balcony for the muezzin is interesting. Gagarins drawing captures large articulations of the supporting stalactite cornice, under which there is an inscription ribbon. Above the balcony there is of an elongated proportions a small lancet opening.\n\nThe top of the minaret represents the starting material for the restoration of approximately same time minarets in Karabaglar and Nakhichevan. The minaret is completed with a kind of\"lantern\" with a light end-to-end arcade. The combination of the \"lantern\" with a developed balcony is somewhat unusual for a muezzin and therefore rare. Such a \"flashlight\" is common in the minarets of the neighbouring countries. It is not found in the minarets of Shirvan, and for the muezzin it was intended a balcony with a circular detour. The figure also shows the difference in the patterns of the brickwork of the tower up to its top. In addition, a wide decorative strip stands out on the tower cut by slit-like openings, approximately at the height of its upper third.\n\nKufic tower inscription\n\nIn 1970, when laying a gas pipeline in the Shamkir region, the Azerbaijan SSR, a Kufic inscription was discovered on the site of the Shamkir town. It is shedding light on its purpose and date of construction. The Arabic-language inscription on this stone slab, which is nowadays in the Museum of History of Azerbaijan, says that the tower was built at the expense of the Sheikh al-Saleh ibn Afshin in 493 AH (1099/1100).\n\n\"Bismillah, with the help of Almighty Allah, at his request, under his protective means of Sheikh al-Saleh ibn Afshin, was ordered to build this watchtower in the series of defensive structures in the year four hundred ninety-three.\"\n\nThe Azerbaijani historian Meshadikhanum Neymat examined the text of the inscription and came to the conclusion that the Shamkir minaret was one of those structures that were designated for coverage, that is, the defence of the city. It served as a watchtower. Neymat noted that the inscription also shows that the minaret was built not in the 12-13th centuries, as the researchers of the monument&#39;s history construction assumed, but at the end of the 11th century.",
  "Wojciech Rojowski\n\nWojciech Rojowski (died 1778) was a Polish sculptor and woodcarver. His date of birth is not known. Information on the life Rojowski is scarce. He probably had a workshop in Krak\u00f3w. He performed mainly sculptures and decorating the interior of churches in Krak\u00f3w. He worked in stucco and wood in the Rococo style. His works are characterized by their richness of decoration. In 1750, he completed the stucco decoration of the altar of St. John of Nepomuk in the Pauline Church Na Ska\u0142ce (On the Rock). In the years 1758-1766 he worked on the interior decoration of the Bernardine Church, Lviv.

  "Awaken (mixtape)\n\nAwaken is the debut mixtape by American singer-songwriter Keke Palmer. It was officially released on March 18, 2011 for downloads on mixtape-downloading websites. It has not been released as a digital download or as an album. Three of the songs appear on Palmer's debut album, So Uncool. The only single \"The One You Call\" was released on iTunes on January 8, 2011, and was sent to Urban radio the same day. A music video was also released for the song. It premiered on Palmer's official YouTube channel and iTunes.\n\nBackground\n\nPalmer released Awaken as a teaser of her upcoming new music, expected to be released in 2012. Palmer hoped that the mixtape would boost interest in her upcoming music. Three tracks from the mixtape appeared on her debut album, So Uncool: \"The Game Song\", \"Bottoms Up\" and \"Keep it Movin'\", each was released in 2007.\n\nPromotion\n\nPalmer sang her song \"Top of the World\" at the 2009 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade on the Build-a-Bear Workshop float. Many of the songs were also leaked by Palmer on her official YouTube channel before the release of the mixtape.\n\nCritical reception\n\nThe reviews for Awaken are mostly positive, many complimenting Palmer's vocals, but questioning its ability to chart.\n\nPeggy Oliver from The Urban Music Scene said \"Palmer\u2019s crystal voice is pleasing and soulful. As for the music on the Awaken Mixtape, the production is clean yet there are several auto tune spots and just so-so background vocals in certain places, which seem par for the course in today\u2019s urban market. Thus, the question is not whether Palmer has very good vocal capabilities. It is a matter of whether her music at this point can stand toe to toe with the more prolific urban vocal talent hitting the charts today.\"\n\nTerrellVanity.com also gave it a positive review saying that the tracks \"SuperJerkin\", \"Keke\u2019s Love\", \"Hard To Breathe\", and \"The One you Call\" were their favorite tracks. They also said that they could see \"Get Out My Head\" being played on the radio.\n\nThe One You Call\n\n\"The One You Call\" is the only single released from Keke Palmer's first mixtape Awaken.

It was only played 272 times on the US radio, during 2010.\n\nMusic video\n\nThe official music video was released November 23, 2010. It was directed by Gabe Evans and Ryan Parma.

  "WWF In Your House (video game)\n\nWWF In Your House is a video game for the PlayStation, Sega Saturn, and DOS. Developed by Sculptured Software, it is a follow-up to WWF WrestleMania: The Arcade Game and was published by Acclaim Entertainment, who had previously released WrestleMania for home consoles.\n\nDescription\n\nJust like WrestleMania, In Your House is not a wrestling game in the normal sense, as it is heavily influenced by Mortal Kombat. It features digitized sprites of the wrestlers, and many over the top, unrealistic, and magical moves and taunts by the wrestlers. The game also features finishing moves which are performed before the final pin.\n\nInstead of typical wrestling arenas, WWF In Your House featured personalised stages for each individual wrestler, such as a nightclub for Shawn Michaels, Stu Hart's Dungeon for Bret Hart and a crypt for The Undertaker.\n\nThe 10 playable wrestlers in the game include Bret Hart, The Undertaker, and Shawn Michaels (all returning from WrestleMania), as well as new additions Owen Hart, The British Bulldog, Goldust, Ahmed Johnson, Hunter Hearst Helmsley (who would all return for 1998's WWF WarZone), Vader, and The Ultimate Warrior (who was fired prior to release due to contract disputes). In-game commentary is supplied by Vince McMahon and \"Mr. Perfect\" Curt Hennig.\n\nDevelopment\n\nEarly in development, Jeff Jarrett was planned to be part of the roster and was even filmed for the game. However, when he left the WWF in early 1996 over a contract dispute, his character was scrapped.\n\nReception\n\nWWF In Your House was a low profile release. At the time Acclaim Entertainment was suffering from financial losses, layoffs, and an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and was pinning most of its hopes on the Nintendo 64 game Turok: Dinosaur Hunter. Perhaps as a result, WWF In Your House was largely ignored by critics; GamePro only reviewed the PlayStation version, and high-profile gaming publications such as Electronic Gaming Monthly and IGN, and even the official Sega Saturn Magazine, did not review it at all.\n\nJohnny Ballgame's review in GamePro called it \"a title full of promise and potential that ultimately gets pinned in its quest for the championship.\" He particularly criticized that matches are over too quickly, and compared the game unfavorably to Power Move Pro Wrestling, which came out at the same time. Jeff Kitts of GameSpot gave the PlayStation version a 5.9 out of 10. He said the action is solid but overly derivative of Mortal Kombat, and that the selection of modes offers no true variety. GameSpots Jeff Gerstmann gave the Saturn version a 4.5 out of 10, calling it \"little more than a rehash of the original\". Both Ballgame and Gerstmann criticized that the gameplay involves little more than pounding the buttons as rapidly as possible, and the style in general is more akin to a fighting game than a true wrestling game. GameSpots Chris Hudak gave the DOS version a 5.6 out of 10, generally ridiculing the wrestling concept.",

  "Uptown, Dallas\n\nUptown is a PID (public improvement district) and a dense upscale neighborhood in Dallas, Texas. Uptown is north of and adjacent to downtown Dallas, and is bordered by US 75 (Central Expressway) on the east, N Haskell Avenue on the northeast, the Katy Trail on the northwest, Bookhout Street and Cedar Springs Road on the west, N Akard Street on the southwest and Spur 366 (Woodall Rodgers Freeway) on the south.\n\nUptown is one of the most pedestrian-friendly areas in all of Texas. It is largely \"new urbanist\" in scope; the majority of facilities considered \"Uptown institutions\" are relatively new and were created during the late 20th and early 21st Centuries' new urbanist urban planning movement. Popular with young professionals, mixed-use development is the norm and an increasingly pedestrian culture continues to thrive.\n\nHistory\n\nThe now-upscale Uptown area was originally outside the city limits of Dallas, and was home to those not welcome in the city. The west side, near present-day Harry Hines Boulevard, once hosted a large Hispanic neighborhood known as Little Mexico. The east side, now anchored by Cityplace Center, was the site of the Freedmen's Town established by freed African-American slaves. Very little of this working-class history remains, with the Hispanic west being turned into high-rise buildings, and the African-American east being destroyed by the construction of Central Expressway and Woodall Rodgers Freeway. All that remains of Freedmen's Town is the Freedmen's Cemetery, which gained national recognition when Central Expressway reconstruction revealed over 1,100 graves beneath existing and proposed roadways.\n\nUntil the late 1990s, this area was simply called the eastern part of Oak Lawn, but was re-branded as \"Uptown\" in the early 2000s to attract real estate investment.\n\nAbout\n\nUptown is one of the most pedestrian-friendly areas in the city of Dallas. It is largely \"new urbanist\" in scope; the majority of facilities considered \"Uptown institutions\" are relatively new and were created during the late 20th and early 21st Centuries' new urbanist urban planning movement.\n\nThe district is one of the most dense in Dallas and is home to a diverse set of establishments including office buildings, residential towers, apartment complexes, retail centers, nightlife strips, and hotels. This mixed-use development practice leads to an urban lifestyle for its residents, unlike the compartmentalized social structures of suburban bedroom communities and office parks which make up the majority of Dallas and its suburbs.\n\n68.9% of Uptown residents hold a bachelor's degree or higher, and the median household income is $79,699.\n\nEconomy\n\nBusinesses continuously relocate to Uptown Dallas to attract educated millennial workers who tend to demand the urban lifestyle that the neighborhood offers. Consequently, despite the boom of high-rise construction in Uptown, the commercial vacancy rate continues to drop and is currently 11.7%, compared to the vacancy rate of 20% in downtown.\n\nThe educated nature of Uptown residents greatly benefits elite firms such as McKinsey & Company, Boston Consulting Group, Bain & Company, Deloitte, PricewaterhouseCoopers, and Goldman Sachs, all of which are located in the neighborhood. Additionally, two Fortune 500 companies call Uptown home: Dean Foods and Holly Frontier.\n\nAlong with commercial high-rises, residential buildings are also going up quickly in Uptown. The newest apartments in Uptown cost an average of $1,800 per month, compared to the Dallas average of $888 per month. Recent projects include the Carlisle & Vine, which consists of 131 apartment homes, and a Whole Foods Market store on the ground level fronting McKinney Avenue.\n\nPublic (Dallas ISD)\n\nResidents are within the Dallas Independent School District.\n\nHouston Elementary School and Milam Elementary School cover portions of Uptown. All residents are zoned to Rusk Middle School and North Dallas High School. The William B.

  "Fore River Shipyard\n\nFore River Shipyard was a shipyard owned by General Dynamics Corporation located on Weymouth Fore River in Braintree and Quincy, Massachusetts. It began operations in 1883 in Braintree, and moved to its final location on Quincy Point in 1901. In 1913, it was purchased by Bethlehem Steel, and later transferred to Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation. It was sold to General Dynamics in 1963, and closed in 1986. During its operation, yardworkers constructed hundreds of ships, for both military and civilian clients.\n\nMost of the ships at the yard were built for the United States Navy, with its first government contract for the destroyer USS Lawrence (DD-8). The yard also built early submarines for Electric Boat, including USS Octopus (SS-9) and USS Sunfish (SSN-649). Fore River also constructed the battleship USS Massachusetts (BB-59), and the cruisers USS Springfield (CL-66) and USS Salem (CA-139) as well as the Navy's first carrier USS Lexington (CV-2) and its successor USS Lexington (CV-16). Fore River produced multiple foreign ships for various navies around the world including five Type 1 submarines for the Imperial Japanese Navy, ten submarines for the Royal Navy, and the battleship, for the Argentine Navy.\n\nThe yard constructed several merchant marine ships, including Thomas W. Lawson, the largest pure sailing ship ever built, and, which was the first ship constructed to carry refrigerated chemicals. General Dynamics Quincy Shipbuilding Division, as it eventually came to be known, ended its career as a producer of various LNG tankers and merchant marine ships.\n\nThe yard would also construct a number of American flagged passenger liners, which included Matson Line's SS Mariposa, SS Monterey, SS Lurline, along with American Export Lines SS Independence and SS Constitution.\n\nAccording to one theory, the yard was the origin of the \"Kilroy was here\" pop culture reference, and was home to the second-largest shipbuilding crane in the world. During the period in which it was operable, the yard had two sub-yards: the first was the Victory Destroyer Plant in Quincy during World War I, and the second was the Bethlehem Hingham Shipyard in Hingham during World War II. In addition, the yard owned Bethlehem Atlantic Works, a drydock facility which was located in East Boston.\n\nOrigins\n\nThe shipyard traces its beginnings back to 1882, when Thomas A. Watson purchased a farm alongside the Fore River in East Braintree, Massachusetts. In 1884, Watson attempted to farm the land, but soon realizing that it was a failure, decided to work on a steam engine after he was approached by a local businessman. Work on the engine began in 1884, and continued into 1885, when it was deemed a financial failure. At this point, Watson decided to work with his business partner Frank O. Wellington on ship building, creating the Fore River Engine Company.\n\nFore River Engine Company\n\nFollowing an order from Maine for a 50-horsepower engine, Thomas A. Watson and Frank O. Wellington decided to build boats, which came after realizing the profitability of the enterprise as the result of building their first ship, the Barnacle, which was fitted with local furnishings. Watson later said of this decision:\n\nIt was a momentous decision for from it came one of the largest shipbuilding establishments in the country, if not in the world, that made Massachusetts again a shipbuilding center and afterwards played an important part in the World War.\n\nThe success of this operation was further strengthened the fact that the shipyard was producing a quality engine, and it quickly gained a reputation along the eastern seaboard. Soon, a new engine-building facility was constructed, employing between twenty and thirty workers. Additionally, the Prouty Printing Press and Sims-Dudley dynamite gun, staple guns for shoes, and electric light accessories were produced by Fore River. In addition, the diversity of Fore River's products was due to the fact that Watson desired to employ as many friends as possible.\n\nThe Panic of 1893 brought a new era to the company, as the depression limited the Fore River's possibilities. Fortunately for Fore River, the United States Navy awarded a contract to them to construct USS Lawrence (DD-8) and USS Macdonough (DD-9). These two ships were the last to be constructed at the East Braintree location, as the yard moved down the river to a site on nearby Quincy Point in 1901. The construction of United States lightship LV-72 alongside the destroyers further strengthened the company financially.\n\nThe awarding of USS Des Moines (CL-17) was also beneficial for Fore River. Faced with the problem of not having a large enough area to build the cruiser, the contract was produced at the new Quincy yard. The Des Moines was launched in 1902 and commissioned in 1904, bringing with it some financial stability to the yard, as new revenues were quadruple those at the East Braintree location. During the construction of the new yard, old buildings were floated over to make up for the lack of buildings at the new location, and it was constructed with some of the largest shipbuilding equipment of the day.\n\nFore River Ship and Engine Company\n\nThe building of the new yard created ample space for building new ships, which allowed for the building of USS New Jersey (BB-16) and USS Rhode Island (BB-17). The Navy did mandate that before they could receive the bids, they would have to incorporate, so the company was incorporated in New Jersey, with a capital of $ (equivalent to $ in today's dollars). Immediately, Thomas A. Watson realized that the contract would be more costly than anticipated, but soon an order came in for the seven-masted Thomas W. Lawson. This was immediately followed by an order for the six-masted William L. Douglas, which was delivered in 1903.\n\nIn 1902, Watson decided to build the Fore River Railroad, a short-line railroad from East Braintree to the yard, 3 mi away. This was done in order to save costs of having to remove supplies from the trains, transport it over land to Weymouth Fore River, and then float it over to the yard. Watson ended up buying a parcel of land after the owner refused to sell him 3 ft of land for the railroad.\n\nDuring this time, the yard struggled financially, as expenses from suppliers exceeded reimbursement from the Navy. As a result, Watson decided to sell some of his telephone stock and secured a loan. At this time, the yard was awarded with a contract for USS Vermont (BB-20), although this did not solve the company's troubles. Following a failed attempt by Watson to seek reimbursement from the Navy, he eventually resigned and was replaced by former Admiral Francis T. Bowles, as he was pleased by how Bowles ran the yard.\n\nIn 1905, the yard gained a contract to build the Brown-Curtis steam turbine engine, which was considered to be too fast to be economical at the time. That same year, the Navy awarded a contract to build the Chester-class cruisers at the yard, two of which were supposed to be equipped with the Brown-Curtis turbine, but which later received new turbines.\n\nThe Russo-Japanese War further benefited the yard, as the Imperial Japanese Navy contracted five Type 1 submarines at the yard. Little is known of the first submarines built at the yard, although they were promptly disassembled and shipped to the West Coast, from which they were shipped to Japan in 1904. The war brought expanded submarine development to the yard, as the Holland Torpedo Boat Company was purchased by the Electric Boat Company. Since Electric Boat had no yard of its own, it subcontracted to Fore River in order to complete orders. The first American submarine built at the yard was USS Octopus (SS-9), launched in 1906. This arrangement lasted for the next twenty years, until Electric Boat built its own yard in 1924. Fore River would remain the primary builder of Electric Boat-designed submarines through the S-class of 1922, completing a total of 69 submarines for the US Navy during this period.\n\nDuring this time, the yard built civilian ships, including Sankaty, which was built for the New Bedford, Martha's Vineyard & Nantucket Steamboat Company. Furthermore, the company created the Fore River Apprentice School, in order to ensure that an adequately trained workforce would be able to work at the yard in the coming years. Over time, over 2,000 people were graduated from its program.\n\nIn 1906, USS New Jersey (BB-16) and USS Rhode Island (BB-17) were delivered by the yard, marking the yard's first battleships delivered. The completion of these two battleships and other ships at the yard coincided at a time when there were 2,500 people employed. In 1908, there were eighteen contracts employed at Fore River, which would not be met again until 1916. The yard also completed car floats for the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad during this time.\n\nOf note, Fore River fielded a soccer team from at least 1907 to around 1920&ndash;1921. This team, which played in local leagues, was part of one of the early soccer leagues in the United States.\n\nAnother big development in the history of the yard was the receiving of the contract to build the for the Argentine Navy. The ship was one of two foreign battleships ever constructed in the United States, and occurred during the South American dreadnought race. After a long bidding process, the Argentine Naval Commission found that the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company",

  "Ghost Hole\n\nThe Ghost Hole was a horror-themed dark ride on Coney Island operated by 12th Street Amusements, a division of Li'l Sassy Anne, Inc. In 2021, the ride was removed and replaced by an expansion of Deno's Wonder Wheel Amusement Park, featuring a Vekoma suspended coaster named the Phoenix, and a kiddie coaster from SBF Visa in 2021.\n\nIn its heyday, the exterior of the ride was painted in graffiti-style imagery and two animated figures, a devil stirring a pot and a large growling demon. At one time, a morass of three serpents was another animated figure on the front of the ride, and other animated figures have been there previously. The serpents were absent for the first part of the 2007 season, though they later returned in greater quantity, though the two on the right come too close together, rubbing off the foam rubber eye of the rightmost serpent. A greenish vulture was also added to the leftmost window. In front of the ride, a glass case held an animatronic figure who simultaneously vomits and defecates while hunched over a toilet. The ride's cars were like bumper cars, but were in multiple colors and have heavier protective guards that are lowered over riders. After April 2009, two virtually identical vultures were placed on the exterior of the ride, the serpents were again removed, and the vomiter/defecator was given a female likeness, including a long blonde wig and a black skirt.\n\nThe ride opened with a long trek up a slope similar to a roller coaster. A halved man hung from the ceiling over the car, and the first full stunt passed was of an electric chair execution. After a brief U-turn outside, one was greeted by a bulging eyed bellhop and a plunge down another slope past several strands that made contact with the rider. At the bottom of this dark passage were torches, horror-oriented familial groups sitting together, torture victims, Tiki creatures, a snapping alligator, and another vomiting man (the vomit was obviously water sprayed hard and wide), among others. Some of these leaned threateningly toward the rider. This last and longest part of the ride was not a complete building, but housed in black tarpaulin. As far as sound effects, aside from thunder, there was a lot of gunfire, although no guns were shown.",

During the 1960s, the pair designed a wide range of pieces for the German Alfred Kill who had a furniture factory in Fellbach near Stuttgart.\n\nBiography\n\nFabricius was trained as a cabinetmaker by Niels Vodder before attending the School for Interior Design where he studied under Finn Juhl. It was there that he met the blacksmith J\u00f8rgen Kastholm. They had a common approach to furniture design, never wanting to compromise on aesthetics. In 1961, the pair set up a design studio in a Gentofte cellar without any firm arrangements with manufacturers. In 1965, they exhibited at the furniture fair in Fredericia where the German furniture manufacturer Alfred Kill noticed their work. Kill had a reputation for high quality but initially Favricius and Kastholm were not keen to design furniture for factory production. Only when Kill offered them DM 2,500 a month each, with no preconditions, did they agree to work for him. They travelled to Stuttgart with their first designs for production in Kill's factory in nearby Fellbach. Their international breakthrough came at the Cologne Fair in 1966 when they exhibited a whole series of office and home furniture leading to orders from ten large furniture concerns. Their minimalistic designs, both attractive and comfortable, were usually in steel and leather. The Tulip Chair, the Grasshopper Chair and the Scimitar Chair are among their most successful works.\n\nThe pieces of furniture they produced during their seven-year period of cooperation from 1961 to 1968 were so distinctive that many are still produced today as classics.

  "Varscona Theatre\n\nThe Varscona Theatre is a live performance venue in the Old Strathcona neighborhood of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Since 1994, the Varscona has been operated by a consortium of small theatre companies, including Teatro la Quindicina and Shadow Theatre (collectively known as The Varscona Theatre Alliance). The theatre is also the home of the nationally renowned live improvised soap opera Die-Nasty. In addition, the Varscona has hosted tapings of The Irrelevant Show, a national sketch comedy program aired on CBC Radio. The Varscona holds over 300 performances and has 30,000 audience members per year. It employs 100 local professional theatre artists.\n\nHistory\n\nThe building was originally constructed as Edmonton's Fire Hall #6 in 1956, which replaced the original Fire Hall #6, built in 1909, across the street (the 1909 building has been home to The Walterdale Playhouse since 1974). Fire Station #6 was later relocated to 81 Avenue & 96 Street, and the building was repurposed as a theatre in 1982.\n\nPrior to being renamed as The Varscona Theatre in 1996, the current building was called the Chinook Theatre, and served as the headquarters of Chinook Children's Theatre and the Edmonton International Fringe Festival from 1983-1993. It is still used as a venue during the Fringe Festival every August.\n\nName\n\nThe Varscona's name is an homage to Edmonton's original Varscona Theatre, a 1940s art deco movie theatre formerly located at the intersection of Whyte Avenue & 109 Street. The movie theatre was demolished in 1987 for the construction of a credit union (later a TD Canada Trust). The 1987 building was subsequently demolished and replaced, in 2009, by a Shoppers Drug Mart.\n\nRenovations\n\nIn 2012, the theatre announced plans for a significant rehabilitation project. The plan would see the majority of the theatre demolished and rebuilt, with only the exterior brick walls and iconic tower remaining in the new structure. The project was to address the significant mechanical and utility failures that had developed in the building over the years, as well as expand the small lobby and backstage areas, which have plagued the building since its conversion from a fire hall. The theatre will also increase in capacity from 176 to 200 seats, with improved sight-lines, and the audio and lighting systems will be completely replaced.\n\nIn May 2013 the Government of Alberta announced a $2 million grant for renovation of the facility. The City of Edmonton and Government of Canada have also contributed funding to the $7.5 million project, with the remaining of funds coming from public donations. While the renovation project was underway, the Varscona Theatre Alliance built, and moved all performances into, The Backstage Theatre at the Fringe Theatre Adventures in the ATB Financial Arts Barns, one block away.

He played Major League Baseball as a center fielder in the National League with the Philadelphia Phillies (1898\u20131899) and Baltimore Orioles (1899), and for the Philadelphia Athletics (1901\u20131902) and New York Highlanders (1903\u20131905) of the American League. He batted and threw right-handed. In a seven-season career, Fultz posted a.271 batting average with 223 RBI and three home runs in 644 games played. Fultz played college football and college baseball at Brown University, from which he graduated in 1898. He served as the head football coach at the University of Missouri (1898\u20131899), Lafayette College (1902), Brown (1903), and New York University (1904), compiling a career college football coaching record of 26\u201319\u20132. Fultz was also the head baseball coach at the United States Naval Academy in 1907 and at Columbia University from 1910 to 1911.\n\nEarly life and career\n\nA native of Staunton, Virginia, Fultz graduated in 1898 with a law degree from Brown University, where he excelled in football and baseball and was named captain of both teams. Signed by the Phillies the same year, he played for them in part of two seasons and went to Baltimore in the 1899 midseason and played under John McGraw. With McGraw, Fultz developed as a solid base stealer, and in hit and run and bunting situations.\n\nLater career in baseball\n\nWhen the American League was created, Fultz joined the Philadelphia Athletics of Connie Mack in 1901, appearing at shortstop and second base, and later moved to center field. Fultz led his team with 36 stolen bases and hit.292 with 95 runs scored. His most productive season came in 1902, when he stole 44 bases, hit a career-high.302, and led the American League with 109 runs. On September 4, he stole second base, third and home, in the second inning of a game against the Detroit Tigers.\n\nFrom 1903 to 1905, Fultz played for the New York Highlanders when Clark Griffith managed the team. During the offseason and in his spare time he attended New York Law School, passing the New York bar exam. Fultz averaged 30 stolen bases per season with a high 42 in 1905. That season, he suffered a late September collision with teammate Kid Elberfeld, breaking his nose and jaw, and retired at 31 age.\n\nFootball playing career\n\nFultz also played professional football in 1900 and 1901 with the Homestead Library & Athletic Club, as a fullback. In 1901 he was named the team's captain. Prior to playing for Homestead, Fultz played football for the Duquesne Country and Athletic Club in 1899.\n\nCoaching career\n\nFultz served as the head football coach at the University of Missouri (1898\u20131899), Lafayette College (1902), Brown University (1903), and New York University (1904), compiling a career college football record of 26\u201319\u20132. He also coached baseball at the United States Naval Academy, Columbia University and NYU.\n\nFultz got his first coaching job in 1898 as the eighth head football coach at the University of Missouri. Missouri finished with a 1\u20134\u20131 record under Fultz. He returned to coach the Tigers for one game in 1900, a victory, before handing over the reins to his former Brown teammate, Fred W.

  "SMS Kaiserin Elisabeth\n\nSMS Kaiserin Elisabeth was a protected cruiser of the Austro-Hungarian Navy. Named in honor of the Empress Elisabeth, consort of Emperor Franz Josef, the cruiser was designed for overseas service and in fact was stationed in China at the outbreak of World War I in 1914.\n\nSpecifications\n\nLaunched at the naval shipyard at Pola on 25 September 1890, Kaiserin Elisabeth was a steel-hulled vessel of 3,967 tons displacement. She measured 321 ft in waterline length with a beam of 49 ft and a mean draft of 19 ft. The crew comprised 450 officers and men.\n\nPropulsion\n\nPropulsion was provided by two sets of horizontal triple expansion engines with four cylindrical double-ended boilers. Designed performance was 6,400 hp for 18 kn and 8000 hp for 19 kn; on trials she in fact reached 20 kn.\n\nArmament\n\nOriginally Kaiserin Elisabeth was armed with two 24 cm and six 15 cm guns, both types Model 1886. In 1905-06 she was reconstructed with two long-barreled 15 cm and six short-barreled 15 cm guns, both types Model 1901. Rounding out her armament were 16 47 mm quick-firing guns, one machine gun and four 14 in torpedo tubes located above water, two on either beam.\n\nService\n\nAlthough Kaiserin Elisabeth burned enormous quantities of coal, in 1914 she could still steam at a very fair speed and was stationed in China. Upon the outbreak of the First World War, Kaiserin Elisabeth took part in the defense of the German colony of Tsingtao, which was besieged by the Japanese on 25 August 1914; Japan had declared war on Germany on 23 August and the presence of Kaiserin Elisabeth led to Japan declaring war on Austria-Hungary on 25 August. At Tsingtao with Kaiserin Elisabeth were the Imperial German Navy light cruiser, gunboats,, and  and the torpedo boat. (The German Asiatic Squadron, normally based at Tsingtau, had made a dash for home across the Pacific.) The ship\u2032s crew was divided into two groups; one continued manning the ship, while the other bolstered the German garrison.\n\nOn 6 September 1914 the first air-sea battle in history took place when a Japanese Farman MF.11 aircraft launched by the seaplane carrier unsuccessfully attacked Kaiserin Elisabeth with bombs.\n\nEarly in the siege Kaiserin Elisabeth and Jaguar made a sortie against the Japanese. Later, Kaiserin Elisabeth s 15 cm and 4.7 cm guns were removed and mounted ashore in \"Batterie Elisabeth.\" As the siege progressed, the naval vessels trapped in the harbor were scuttled -- Cormoran, Iltis and Luchs on 28 September, S90 on 17 October and Tiger on 29 October. Finally, Kaiserin Elisabeth was scuttled on 2 November, followed by Jaguar on 7 November, the day the fortress surrendered to the Japanese.",
  "Pirapora\n\nPirapora is a municipality in northcentral Minas Gerais in Brazil. The population is 56,640 (2020 est.) in an area of 550 km\u00b2. The name Pirapora comes from the Tupi words for \"fish\" + \"jump\", referring to the piracema season when a mass migration of fishes ascends the S\u00e3o Francisco River to spawn.\n\nLocation\n\nPirapora belongs to its own statistical microregion. The elevation of the municipal seat is 472 meters. It became a municipality in 1912. This municipality is located on the right bank of the S\u00e3o Francisco River and is 340 km from the state capital.\n\nNeighboring municipalities are: Lagoa Grande, Coromandel, Guarda-Mor, Lagamar and Paracatu. There are two districts, besides the municipal seat: Claro de Minas, 12 km. distant, and Vazamor, 32 km. distant.\n\nMicroregion of Pirapora\n\nThe statistical microregion of Pirapora includes 9 cities: Buritizeiro, V\u00e1rzea da Palma, Ibia\u00ed, Jequita\u00ed, S\u00e3o Rom\u00e3o, Lassance, Riachinho, Santa F\u00e9 de Minas and Lagoa dos Patos. It has an area of 23,111 km2 and a population of approximately 150,000 inhabitants.\n\nHistory\n\nThe city is located on the right bank of the great S\u00e3o Francisco River, the longest river to flow entirely inside Brazilian territory. Its history goes back to the colonial period of the bandeirantes and the gold panhandlers who followed the river upstream, arrived at the rapids of Pirapora and founded the settlement of S\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alo das Tabocas. In 1911 the small Arraial de S\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alo de Pirapora became the seat of a municipality and its name was shortened to Pirapora. Its street plan was laid out in the form of a chess set, inspired by the new capital of Belo Horizonte, and the streets were given names of Brazilian states.\n\nThere are highway connections with the main federal highway, the BR 040, to the west. In 1910 the railroad came up from the south and reached Pirapora, with a bridge (694 m) being built across the river. There were plans to extend the line to the coast. At the end of the nineteen seventies the line was deactivated, but the bridge and the rails still remain.\n\nToday the river has lost its economic importance and is mainly used by tourist boats that attempt to recreate the spirit of the past, when Mississippi style riverboats were used to go as far as Juazeiro in Bahia. These boats used charcoal, which contributed to the disappearance of the vegetation along the river. One of the old paddle wheel steamboats, the Benjamim Guimar\u00e3es, can still be seen anchored in front of the city and is a major tourist site.\n\nThe economy\n\nThe main economic activities are industry, cattle raising, farming (both extensive mechanized and subsistence), goods and services, and tourism. The GDP for 2005 was R$662,985,000. In the rural area there were 605 farms and a total agricultural area of 57,000 hectares, of which 38,000 ha. were planted, 14,000 were in natural pasture, and 13,000 ha. were in woodland or forest. 2,800 people were dependent on farming. 107 of the farms had tractors. In 2006 there were 9,600 head of cattle. With irrigation Pirapora has become a major producer of tropical fruits, growing eating grapes, papaya, mangoes, cantaloupe, and guava. There is also production on a smaller scale of corn, beans, rice, manioc, tomatoes, lettuce, and bananas.\n\nAccording to the city government site, Pirapora is the second most important city in the north of Minas, after Montes Claros, in industrial output. There is an industrial park where several small and medium industries are installed. Iron silicon, metallic silicon, and textiles are produced.\n\nHealth and education\n\nIn 2005 there were 39 health establishments\u201425 public and 14 private. There was 01 public hospital and 02 private hospitals. The number of hospital beds was 133. The Centro Regional de Sa\u00fade da Vis\u00e3o is a public clinic that specializes in eye surgery and attracts patients from all over the north of Minas Gerais.\n\nIn 2007 there were three institutes of higher learning in the city: Instituto Educacional Santo Agostinho (private), Uni\u00e3o de Ensino de Minas Gerais Ltda (private), and UNIMONTES-Universidade Estadual de Montes Claros (public).\n\nThe score on the Municipal Human Development Index was 0.758. Pirapora was ranked 235 out of 853 municipalities in the state, with Po\u00e7os de Caldas in first place with 0.841 and Setubinha in last place with 0.568.",

  "PPE Portrait project\n\nThe PPE Portrait project started during the 2014\u20132015 Ebola outbreak in Liberia by artist Mary Beth Heffernan as a way to humanize physicians, nurses and other medical professionals wearing full personal protective equipment (PPE). Patients experiencing one of the most terrifying times of their lives are unable to see the faces of their medical staff, but having a photo sticker on the staff member's PPE gown allows the patient to better relate to their caregiver. This project was revived in 2020 by Stanford social scientist Cati Brown-Johnson and featured on The Rachel Maddow Show, NPR, Smithsonian magazine and KQED.\n\n2014\u20132015 Ebola outbreak\n\nThe idea came from the 2014\u20132015 Ebola outbreak in Liberia. American artist Mary Beth Heffernan, who is a professor of art and art history at Occidental College, saw the full suits the Ebola health workers were wearing and she created the PPE Portrait Project. Heffernan called it \"an art intervention designed to improve Ebola care\". Regarding cultural sensitivity, Heffernan said that developing the project \"involved close readings of Ebola survivors\u2019 stories, in particular the first-person narratives of doctors who became infected and lived to write about it. Their stories were electrifying, and the words they chose to describe their experience\u2014of being sick, isolated, and the trauma of not seeing a human face in their caregivers\u2014are seared in my mind.\" The grant funded project focused on isolation of patients\u2014the benefits of \"puncturing that isolation\" by allowing patients to better connect with their providers. Liberian doctors J. Soka Moses and Moses Massaquoi invited Heffernan to visit with the Ebola doctors and staff. Massaquoi said that he was receiving emails from people \"pitching some untested scheme... it was getting to be kind of a pain\". But the proposal to put photos on the suits made so much sense he responded to Heffernan immediately. Heffernan told Maddow staff that she \"had hoped the PPE portraits would become standard best medical practice for all kinds of patients who have to experience isolation of never seeing people outside of PPE\u2014only masked faces for days at a time.\"\n\nThe Gold Foundation funded Heffernan to travel to Liberia. Heffernan had received $5,000 that she was using for this project. Health care staff there \"reported feeling more human\". She spent three weeks training the staff and left supplies for them to use. Heffernan wanted the project to be \"sustainable and achievable with local means.\"\n\nThe project was featured in the Being Human exhibition at the Wellcome Collection in London in September 2019. The exhibit featured mannequins dressed in PPE with PPE Portrait labels. Heffernan provided first-person narratives from the healthcare workers featured to accompany the exhibit. Those featured received an honorarium for the use of their image and story.\n\nIn the five years since the Ebola outbreak, Heffernan approached many hospitals but found that they were uninterested. Medical staff wearing full PPE during the COVID-19 pandemic has changed that attitude with many hospitals. However, many of the providers involved in the original project have reported that they are not currently using PPE Portrait labels, as they are instead focused on the challenges of \"sourcing and rigorously using the PPE itself.\"\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic\n\n\"So your terrified patients who can't actually see really any of your face, at least have some idea of who you are and what you really look like\"\n\n- Rachel Maddow, May 8, 2020\n\nCati Brown-Johnson from Stanford University School of Medicine revived the project for the COVID-19 pandemic. She says she is a social scientist who is interested in human connections. Brown-Johnson says the research behind this idea shows that \"a warm and competent provider connects with the healing mechanisms within a person's own body. And PPE, obviously it's straight up and down... competence. It tells you competence right away, the only warmth you might get would be a PPE portrait, that is some of the basis of the research that has us interested in pursuing this.\" Brown-Johnson further said that they are seeing an improvement in the morale of the medical staff as it makes them feel more humanized. Brown-Johnson first tried out the revived program at a drive-thru testing site at Stanford.\n\nStaff during one of the trial tests for the project said that right away they noticed better interactions with patients. One nurse, Anna Chico who worked in the drive-up COVID\u201119 testing site, said she introduced herself by pointing to her portrait and saying \"this is me under all this\". Doctors reported that it felt like they were working with people on the team, \"instead of inanimate objects\".\n\nThe Rachel Maddow Show learned about this project when they noticed that doctor Ernest Patti from St. Barnabas Hospital, whom they had interviewed several times on the show about his experiences working with COVID\u201119 patients, appeared in full PPE but with a smiling photo of himself on the outside of his PPE gown. The Maddow staff inquired with Patti and learned that a woman had seen him on previous Maddow shows and mailed him a set of stickers of his own face for use on his gown. The woman was Dr. Lori Justice Shocket who is an artist and holds a medical degree. She is also married to an ER doctor and has a child and step-child who are also ER doctors. Shocket asks people to email her photos of their faces; she prints stickers and mails them back.\n\nThe goal of the project according to Heffernan is to give hospitals the tools and training so they can independently run the project. She hopes that all medical professionals will use PPE portraits whenever they wear masks irrespective of if they are in full PPE or not. In situations where medical staff are wearing a mask, seeing a smiling photo would be beneficial for the patient. Maddow further said of the PPE Portrait project that seeing a photo of their caregiver helps create a genuine connection instead of an \"alien connection, even when they are doing the best to save your life\". Smithsonian magazine states the feeling of seeing someone in full PPE is like \"anonymizing these individuals as masked, expressionless staff members in space suits\". In Liberia, Heffernan said that the medical workers \"found themselves perceived as'scary ninjas'\u2014are isolating, dehumanizing and compound patient fear\".\n\nOther hospitals starting to use PPE portraits as of April 2020 are the University of Massachusetts Medical School, USC Keck School of Medicine and Boston Children's Hospital.\n\n\"Attaching photos to PPE is such a simple, low-tech tool\u2014yet it can transform those precious moments of care at a time when patients are sick, scared, and feeling alone. We were so glad to support Mary Beth Heffernan and her brilliant idea in her initial PPE Portrait Project work. We urge all hospitals to adopt this practice, so that both patients and healthcare teams can benefit.\"\n\n- Dr. Richard I. Levin, President and CEO of the Gold Foundation\n\nPracticalities\n\nStanford Medicine's website suggests that in high-risk settings the photo will be discarded with the disposal of the gown. In lower risk settings where the gown will be reused, the photo sticker will need to be disinfected before using the gown, much in the same way a name badge would be. Stanford suggests that if someone is creating the portrait of themself, they should use the portrait setting on their smartphone, look directly into the camera lens and \"offer the smile you want your patients to see\". Heffernan recommends using 8.5\"\u00d711\" matte surface sticky labels that are not reusable. Laminating, disinfecting and reusing was first discussed but there were concerns that the hard edge of the plastic might damage the PPE gown and become a source for contamination. Medical staff can keep a supply of photo labels in the donning area. It is suggested that the photo be worn at \"heart level, because your care is coming from your heart\".",

  "L'huomo di lettere\n\nL'huomo di lettere difeso ed emendato (Rome, 1645) by the Ferrarese Jesuit Daniello Bartoli (1608-1685) is a two-part treatise on the man of letters bringing together material he had assembled over twenty years since his entry in 1623 into the Society of Jesus as a brilliant student, a successful teacher of rhetoric and a celebrated preacher. His international literary success with this work led to his appointment in Rome as the official historiographer of the Society of Jesus and his monumental Istoria della Compagnia di Gesu (1650-1673).\n\nThe entire patrimony of classical rhetoric was centered around the figure of the Ciceronian Orator, the vir bonus dicendi peritus of Quintilian as the ideal combination of moral values and eloquence. In Jesuit terms this dual ideal becomes  santit\u00e0 e lettere for membership in the emerging Republic of Letters. Bartoli confidently asserts the validity of this model represented in his huomo di lettere. In his introduction Bartoli constructs his two part presentation out of a maxim of oratory, that recalls Quintilian, but is of his fashioning: \"Si qua obscuritas litterarum, nisi quia sed obtrectationibus imperitorum vel abutentium vitio\" And he effectively dramatizes a tableau of the archetypical Anaxagoras enlightening the ignorant by demystifying the cause of a solar eclipse through his scientific understanding. This is a prelude to the cohort of ancient philosophers he employs as part of his rhetorical agenda to characterize the Senecan literatus as the model for his philosopher hero, the man of letters. Part I defends the man of letters against the neglect of rulers and fortune and make him a conduit of an intellectual beatitude, il gusto dell'intendere, that is the basis of his moral and social Ataraxia. He develops his theme of Stoic superiority under two headings, La Sapienza felice anche nelle Miserie and L'Ignoranza misera anche nelle Felicit\u00e0 with regular reference to the Epistulae morales ad Lucilium of Seneca, and exempla taken from Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, Plutarch, Pliny, Aelian, with frequent quotations, often unsourced, from Virgil and the poets, and headed by Augustine and Tertullian and Synesius among the Christian writers. Part II seeks to emend the faults of the present day writer in 9 chapters under the headings, Ladroneccio, Lascivia, Maldicenza, Alterezza, Dapoccaggine, Imprudenza, Ambitione, Avarizia, Oscurita. He calls on more modern authors in these chapters, such as Oviedo, Erasmus and Cardanus. The final chapter takes particular aim at excesses of the precious baroque style then in vogue and encourages the beginner to profit from the ars rhetorica expounded by Cicero in style and composition. His paraenesis combines a stream of classical exempla with modern instances of the great Italian explorers, such as his heroes in geography, Columbus, and astronomy, Galileo, and lively references to the modern tradition of Italian letters from Dante, his favorite, to Ariosto and Tasso.\n\nDell'Huomo di lettere difeso ed emendato 1645\n\nIn 1645 the appearance of Bartoli's first book initiated an international literary sensation. The work, reprinted eight times in the first year, quickly inserted itself in the regional literary debates of the time, with an unauthorized Florentine edition (1645) dedicated to Salvator Rosa soon challenged by a Bolognese edition (1646) dedicated to Virgilio Malvezzi. Over the following three decades and beyond there were another thirty printings at a dozen different Italian presses, especially Venetian, of which half a dozen \"per Giunti\" with a signature frontispiece title illustration.\n\nBartoli's literary \"how to\" book spread its influence well beyond the geographical and literary confines of Italy. During the process of her conversion to Roman Catholicism at the hands of the Jesuits in the 1650s Christina, Queen of Sweden specifically requested a copy of this celebrated work be sent to her in Stockholm. It seems to have fulfilled the Baroque dream of an energetic rhetorical eloquence to which the age aspired. Through its gallery of exemplary stylizations and picturesque moral encouragements it defends and emends not only the aspiring letterato, but also an updated classicism open to modernity, but diffident of excess. The book's international proliferation made it a vehicle of the cultural ascendancy of the Jesuits as modern classicists during the Baroque. Years later, Bartoli provided a revision for the collected edition. After Bartoli's death in 1685 editions of his works continued to appear, particularly in the early nineteenth century when he was idolized for his mastery of language and style. Giacinto Marietti printed an excellent complete edition of Bartoli in Turin between 1825 and 1856.\n\nTranslations\n\nIn Bartoli's lifetime and beyond, in addition to the host of Italian editions, his celebrated work was translated into six different languages by men of letters of other nationalities, Jesuits and non-Jesuits, illustrating on a European scale the Baroque vogue that Bartoli enjoyed in the Republic of Letters of his time. Ie appeared in 1651 in French, in 1654 in German, in 1660 in English, in 1672 in Latin, in 1678 in Spanish and in 1722 in Dutch.\n\nLa Guide des Beaux Esprits 1651\n\nThe French translation was first to appear in 1651. It was done by the Jesuit writer Thomas LeBlanc, (1599-1669) upon his return from Italy where the book had made Bartoli famous for his eloquence and erudition. LeBlanc was author of a five-volume commentary on the Psalms of David in Latin and of several pastoral works in French. It first appeared as L'Homme de lettres (Pont-a-Mousson). In 1654 it was reprinted under the more galant title, La Guide des Beaux Esprits and as such went through several editions. The fifth printing of 1669 was dedicated to Charles Le Jay, Baron de Tilly, from the ascendant noblesse de robe, influential supporters of the Society of Jesus and its colleges. Timoth\u00e9e Hureau de Livoy (1715-1777), a Barnabite priest and lexicographer was the translator of Denina and Muratori. In 1769 his Bartoli translation appeared with critical notes L'Homme de lettres, ouvrage traduit de l'italien augment\u00e9 de Notes historiques et critiques\n\nVertheidigung der Kunstliebenden und Gelehrten Anst\u00e4ndige Sitten 1654\n\nIn N\u00fcrnberg in 1654 a German version appeared anonymously under the title, Vertheidigung der Kunstliebenden und Gelehrten anstandigere Sitten, The translator, Count Georg Adam von Kuefstein (1605-1656) in his preface signs himself Der Kunstliebende, his moniker as a member of the prestigious language academy, the Fruitbearing Society (Fruchtbringende Gesellschaft) under whose name and auspices the book was issued. There is a frontispiece title engraving with a shielded angel \"ratio\" defending \"Vertheidigung\" the writer \"eruditio\". Underneath the book on the writing table there is a scroll which surreptitiously spells out the author's name as \"D. BAR/TOLI\". After the title page come the translator's preface and 11 poetical compositions by other Gesellschaft members including the Nurenberger Georg Philipp Harsd\u00f6rffer, Der Spielende, Sigmund von Birken who oversaw the preparation of the book, Wolf Heimhardt von Hohberg Der Sinnreiche, Cambyse Bianchi del Piano, Der Seltene, from Bologna, who collaborated with Kufstein on the translation, Johan Wilhelm von Stuhlenberg, Der Ungluckselige, Erasmus der Junger von Strahlemberg, Der Liedende, Christoff Dietrick von Schallenberg, Der Schallende and Harsd\u00f6rffer's son, Carl Gottfried. These poetic exercises, including a pastoral dialogue, introduce the themes of Bartoli's text. Bartoli's numerous Latin quotations are given here in German, directly along with the citations in the margin. At the end there is an index for subjects and one for persons and finally a helpful list of the classical authorities with page numbers.\n\nThe Learned Man Defended and Reformed 1660\n\nDuring Cromwell's Protectorate in the 1650s many English notables, such as Sir Kenelm Digby gravitated to Rome and were caught up in the vogue of Bartoli's L'huomo di lettere. Digby is said to have made a translation, but this was not printed, though it is mentioned in the foreword of Thomas Salusbury whose translation coincides with the return of Charles II. The London edition of 1660 celebrates the Restoration of the Stuarts with letters of dedication to two of its chief protagonists George Monck and William Prynne. A connoisseur of Italy and admirer",
  "Maurizio Pollini\n\nMaurizio Pollini (born 5 January 1942) is an Italian pianist. He is known for performances of compositions by Beethoven, Chopin and Debussy, among others. He has also championed and performed works by contemporary composers such as Pierre Boulez, Karlheinz Stockhausen, George Benjamin, Roberto Carnevale, Gianluca Cascioli and Bruno Maderna. Works composed for him include Luigi Nono's..... sofferte onde serene..., Giacomo Manzoni's Masse: omaggio a Edgard Var\u00e8se and Salvatore Sciarrino's Fifth Sonata.\n\nLife and career\n\nPollini was born in Milan to the Italian rationalist architect Gino Pollini, who has been said to be the first to bring Modernist architecture to Italy in the 1930s, and his wife Renata Melotti (sister of the Italian sculptor Fausto Melotti). Pollini studied piano first with Carlo Lonati, until the age of 13, then with Carlo Vidusso, until he was 18. He received a diploma from the Milan Conservatory and won both the International Ettore Pozzoli Piano Competition in Seregno (Italy) in 1959 and the VI International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw in 1960. Arthur Rubinstein, who led the jury, declared Pollini the winner of the competition, allegedly saying: \"that boy can play the piano better than any of us\". Following his success at the competition, Pollini didn't perform for a year in order to expand his musical experience, leading to erroneous rumors that he had become a recluse. Soon afterwards, he recorded Chopin's Concerto No. 1 in E minor with the Philharmonia Orchestra under the Polish conductor Paul Kletzki for EMI, and taped performances of Chopin's etudes. When the Philharmonia offered Pollini a series of concerts, he experienced what EMI producer Peter Andry has called \"an apparent crisis of confidence\". After this, he studied with Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli, from whom he is said to have acquired \"a precise technique and emotional restraint\", although some have expressed a concern that Michelangeli's influence resulted in Pollini's playing becoming \"mannered and cold\". During the early 1960s, Pollini limited his concertizing, preferring to spend these years studying by himself and expanding his repertoire.\n\nSince the mid-1960s, he has given recitals and appeared with orchestras in Europe, the United States, and the Far East. He made his American debut in 1968 and his first tour of Japan in 1974.\n\nIn 1985, on the occasion of Johann Sebastian Bach's tricentenary, he performed the complete first book of The Well-Tempered Clavier. In 1987 he played the complete piano concertos of Ludwig van Beethoven in New York with the Vienna Philharmonic under Claudio Abbado and received on this occasion the orchestra's Honorary Ring. In 1993-94 he played his first complete Beethoven Piano Sonatas cycle in Berlin and Munich and later also in New York City, Milan, Paris, London and Vienna. At the Salzburg Festival in 1995 he inaugurated the \"Progetto Pollini\", a series of concerts in which old and new works are juxtaposed. An analogous series took place at Carnegie Hall in 2000\u201301 with \"Perspectives: Maurizio Pollini\" and at London's Royal Festival Hall in 2010\u201311 with the \"Pollini Project\", a series of five concerts with programmes ranging from Bach to Stockhausen. Throughout his career, Pollini has advocated the performance of little known or forgotten works.\n\nIn March 2012 it was announced that Pollini had cancelled all his forthcoming appearances in the US for health reasons.\n\nIn 2014, Pollini played on a tour including the Salzburg Festival and his debut at the Rheingau Musik Festival, playing in the Kurhaus Wiesbaden Chopin's  Preludes (Op. 28) and Book 1 of Debussy's Preludes.\n\nPollini is father of the pianist and conductor Daniele Pollini.\n\nRecordings\n\nPollini's first recordings for Deutsche Grammophon in 1971 included Stravinsky's Trois mouvements de Petrouchka and Prokofiev's Seventh Sonata and are still considered a landmark of twentieth century piano discography. He recorded Chopin's Etudes, Opp. 10 and 25, also under Deutsche Grammophon. In 2002, Deutsche Grammophon released a 13-CD commemorative edition to celebrate the pianist's 60th birthday, and a complete edition on 58 discs of his recordings for the label, on the occasion of his 75th. His Beethoven Piano Sonatas cycle was completed in 2014 and was released in an 8-CD box set.\n\nWhile known for possessing an exceptional technique, Pollini has been criticised for emotional conservatism. However, in his interviews, Maurizio Pollini has stated that throughout his career his concern has been to express the composer as accurately as possible. He is not concerned with his own emotion.\n\nPolitical views\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, Pollini was a left-wing political activist. He collaborated with Luigi Nono in such works as Como una ola de fuerza y luz (1972), which was to mourn the accidental death of Luciano Cruz, a leader of the Chilean Revolutionary Front. He performed with Claudio Abbado at La Scala in a cycle of concerts for students and workers, in an attempt to build a new public as they believed that art should be for everybody. At least one of Pollini's recitals was beset by audience unrest and concluded upon police intervention when he mentioned Vietnam. Pollini has said that he now questions the way left-wing activists operated in Italy, although he still identifies with the left.\n\nAwards and recognition\n\nIn 1996, Pollini received the Ernst von Siemens Music Prize. In 2001, his recording of Beethoven's Diabelli Variations won the Diapason d'or. In 2007, Pollini received the Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Soloist Performance (without orchestra) for his Deutsche Grammophon recording of Chopin nocturnes. He was awarded the Praemium Imperiale in 2010. He entered the Gramophone Hall of Fame in 2012.",

  "Papaschase\n\nThe Papaschase ( from Cree \u1439\u1426\u1439\u1422\u1489\u1422 (Woodpecker)) are a group of Cree people descended from Chief Papaschase's Band of the 19th century, who were a party to Treaty 6 with Canada. A modern-day group of Papaschase descendants are working to advance their treaty rights and reclaim their reserve's land or get compensation for its loss. They claim the reserve was surrendered unlawfully in 1888, but they have not been recognized yet by the Canadian government.\n\nHistorical Papaschase\n\nChief Papaschase (also known as Passpasschase, Papastew, Pahpastayo, and John Gladieu-Quinn) and his family and community lived around Fort Edmonton, Fort Assiniboia and Slave Lake in Alberta in the mid-1800s and often traded furs with the Hudson Bay Company. They settled permanently in the Edmonton area in the 1850s on the south side of the North Saskatchewan River. Chief Papaschase and his brother Tahkoots signed on to Treaty 6 on August 21, 1877. However, they were not allocated a reserve until three years later, in 1880: reserve (I.R. 136), far from the land along the riverbanks in what later became southeast Edmonton, Alberta including all of Mill Woods. The boundaries in modern terms would be: 51 Avenue on the north, 119 Street on the west, 30 Avenue SW on the south, and 17 Street NW on the east.\n\nMany settlers did not want the reserve near the growing settlement of Edmonton. Frank Oliver, in particular, advocated in his local newspaper, the Edmonton Bulletin, for the removal of the Papaschase Cree from their reserve and for the land to become available to settlers. A meeting was held in 1881 to petition John A. Macdonald to relocate the Papaschase Cree and I.R. 136 away from Edmonton.\n\nIn 1886, around 80 Papaschase members remained on the reserve, as many had taken M\u00e9tis scrip due to starvation, broken treaty promises and lack of assistance from the government. The Papaschase people who took scrip lost their treaty status. The last remaining members left the reserve in 1887 after instruction from Assistant Indian Commissioner, Mr. Reed; many moved to closeby reserves such as the Enoch Cree and the Alexander First Nation. Chief Papaschase died at Elinor Lake in Northern Alberta in 1918.\n\nAccording to Olson (n.d.), \"the Papaschase band lost its entire reserve in South Edmonton under highly questionable circumstances when three men signed a surrender document on November 19, 1888, at a meeting called with four days notice by the government agent. The federal government subdivided the reserve, and sold most of the land at auctions in 1891 and 1893, Land speculators bought most of it, and resold it to settlers. Railway companies also bought some of the land they needed at auction or from speculators\".\n\nThe reserve land was partly used for the Canadian Pacific Railway's Calgary and Edmonton Railway, whose arrival in 1891 caused the birth of a southside hamlet that later became the City of Strathcona. The former reserve, located in Strathcona County, was incrementally absorbed in its entirety by the City of Edmonton over a series of seven annexations between December 30, 1959 and January 1, 1982.\n\nModern Papaschase\n\nIn August 2006, at least 31 Papaschase ancestral remains were repatriated \u2013 some that were being held at the Medical Examiner\u2019s Office and the University of Alberta\u2019s Anthropology Department \u2013 and a reburial ceremony took place at the Epcor\u2019s Rossdale site, which had been recognized as a historic cemetery and is protected by law. Furthermore, with construction projects such as the Walterdale bridge in 2012 and the Terwillegar foot bridge, Papaschase people and other local Indigenous peoples demanded that the government gain consent before construction took place on their lands and burial sites. Now, construction projects on their lands should have archeologists on site, as well as monitors from Indigenous bands present. These are important examples of self-determination.\n\n, around 1,000 people claim to be descendants of the Papaschase band, who they argue was illegally evicted from their reserve to make way for settlement and to give the railway access to their land.\n\nTheir lawsuit against the Canadian government to recover their lands was dismissed in 2008 on the grounds that the Papaschase are not a recognized band and therefore could not make a claim against the government, and that too much time had passed.\n\nSince that time, the group has instead focused its efforts on becoming a recognized band through the Federal Claims Commission, and via political pressure. The current Papaschase website states that \"the Chief and council\u2019s mandate is to govern the Papaschase descendants affairs, to defend and advance their treaty rights and legitimate interests of the Papaschase Descendants, and to take all necessary steps to obtain a just settlement of the unlawful surrender of Papaschase IR 136 in 1888. Many descendants have come forward to join our cause but we continue to search for the lost members who have been scattered to the four winds and call them home\".\n\nA group representing the Papaschase held a partial blockade and information picket on the Queen Elizabeth II portion of Alberta Highway 2 &ndash; Alberta's busiest highway &ndash; on January 16, 2013, as part of the wider Idle No More movement.\n\nIn 2018, the Papaschase Band was recognized as a member of the Assembly of First Nations.",

  "Teutoburg Forest / Egge Hills Nature Park\n\nThe Teutoburg Forest / Egge Hills Nature Park (Naturpark Teutoburger Wald / Eggegebirge) is a nature park founded in 1965 in the northeast of the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. After being expanded in 2008, the nature park is now the largest in Germany, covering an area of 2,700 km2. The park comprise the southern Teutoburg Forest and Egge Hills.\n\nThe Teutoburg Forest / Egge Hills Nature Park won the state competition for nature parks, \"Naturpark.2009.NRW\", with its concept \"Natural Health\" (Nat\u00fcrlich Gesund).\n\nGeography\n\nThe northern part of the nature park begins immediately southeast of Bielefeld and then runs over the southern Teutoburg Forest in a southeasterly direction via Oerlinghausen and Detmold to Horn-Bad Meinberg. The southern part of the area is contiguous to it and runs along the Egge Hills southwards via Bad Driburg and Willebadessen almost as far as Marsberg. In the east, the nature park reaches as far as the River Weser near H\u00f6xter; to the east it extends up to the city boundary of Paderborn. It is adjoined by the Northern Teutoburg Forest-Wiehen Hills Nature Park northwest of Bielefeld.\n\nIn addition to the two Central Upland ranges that give the park its name, there are elements of the Weser Uplands, the Oberw\u00e4lder Land and the Lippe Uplands in the park as well as parts of the karst landscape of the Paderborn Plateau and the Senne. The highest point of the park, at, is the K\u00f6terberg near H\u00f6xter. The second highest elevation is the Preu\u00dfische Velmerstot at. The volcano of Sandebeck in Steinheim-Sandebeck is the northernmost volcano in Germany.\n\nThe regional climate has average annual temperatures of 7 to 8 \u00b0C and average annual precipitation between 625 mm (Warburg) and 1,132 mm (Feldrom).\n\nThe region of the nature park is also called the Health Garden of Germany (Heilgarten Deutschland). The reason for this sobriquet is its unique plethora of natural spa resources, such as brine, bogs, cold and hot springs. There are spas like Bad Salzuflen, Bad Lippspringe, Bad Meinberg and Bad Driburg, as well as numerous climatic and Kneipp spas, on the edge of the Teutoburg Forest. <!--\n\nGeschichte\n\nBereits 1910 wurde die \u201eLippischen Naturschutzvereinigung\u201c gegr\u00fcndet. Ziel war die Ausweisung des \u201eNaturschutzparks Mittelgebirge\u201c mit dem Donoper Teich als Kerngebiet unter Einbeziehung des lippischen Waldes und des lippischen Teils der Senne. Eine entsprechende Anregung an das F\u00fcrstentum Lippe erfolgte 1911 durch den \u201eVerein Naturschutzpark e.V.\u201c\n\nTr\u00e4ger des 1965 gegr\u00fcndeten Naturparkes ist ein Zweckverband bestehend aus den beteiligten Kreisen Lippe, H\u00f6xter, Paderborn, G\u00fctersloh, Hochsauerlandkreis und der kreisfreien Stadt Bielefeld. Die Verbandsversammlung umfasst 22 Vertreter. Der Naturpark ist Mitglied im Dachverband Verband Deutscher Naturparke (VDN) und in der Arbeitsgemeinschaft nordrhein-westf\u00e4lischer Naturparke.\n\nHauptaufgabe des Naturparkes ist die Verkn\u00fcpfung von Erholungsvorsorge und Naturschutz. Im Vordergrund steht hierbei die Schaffung und Sicherung landschaftsbezogener und naturvertr\u00e4glicher Erholungsr\u00e4ume. Zu diesem Zweck verf\u00fcgt der Naturpark \u00fcber ein gut ausgebautes Wanderwegenetz. Auf diese Weise wird die ruhige Mittelgebirgslandschaft unter Ber\u00fccksichtigung des Naturschutzes und des Erlebniswertes erlebbar gemacht. Gleichzeitig werden kulturhistorisch interessante Bereiche wie Burgen, Kl\u00f6ster (z. B. Kloster Dalheim), Stadtw\u00fcstungen (z. B. Blankenrode) oder die Besuchermagneten Hermannsdenkmal und Externsteine erschlossen.\n\nIm Jahr 2008 wurde das Gebiet durch die bisher nicht umfassten Fl\u00e4chen der Kreise H\u00f6xter und Lippe erweitert. Dadurch wuchs die Fl\u00e4che des Naturparks um mehr als das doppelte von 1059 km\u00b2 auf 2711 km\u00b2. -->\n\nName\n\nThe name of the nature park is written \u2013 contrary to typographical conventions \u2013 with spaces either side of the forward slash. This was agreed by the park authority on 6 December 2007. The German language authority, Duden, gives freedom to firms and associations to do this. Strictly, the typographically or orthographically correct way of writing the name would be \"Teutoburg Forest/Egge Hills Nature Park\" (\"Naturpark Teutoburger Wald/Eggegebirge\").\n\nConservation\n\nSome 60% of the area of the nature park is forested. As a large, contiguous forest, the landscape unit fulfils an ecological balancing function. The Egge Hills and the Teutoburg Forest are thus important components of the state-wide wildlife corridor. A good 85% of the area is protected landscape, some 10% is nature reserve and around 14% is Special Areas of Conservation. In addition, there are about 1,000 designated natural monuments (e. g. trees, rock formations, biotopes).\n\nThe mascot of the nature park is the wildcat, whose presence in the region is one of the oldest to have survived to the present day in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia.",

  "Andy Selway\n\nAndy Selway is an English drummer, well known for his work with KMFDM.\n\nSelway spent his early years in Luton, England, but moved to Kirton near Felixstowe, Suffolk, where he remained until his early 20s. From a musical family, he is the eldest of three brothers, the other two being proficient bass (Danny) and brass (Ricky) players.\n\nHe joined Big Boy Tomato, which enjoyed a fair amount of success in North and West London, and their 'New Wave of New Wave' sound saw them supporting bands like UK Subs and Stiff Little Fingers. The Tomatoes managed a couple of EPs, including Acton Baby and the four-track CD Hormones and Hangovers. The Tomatoes split in the early 1990s, and a splinter group emerged. Sugar Snatch took inspiration for their songs from cartoons, namely Asterix and Animaniacs. One album, Mad Cows and Englishmen, was released amidst much touring of the UK and Europe, often playing the supporting slot to Toy Dolls. Seemingly going nowhere, the band split, though two of the members went on to form The Yo-Yos, a punkabilly band formed by Danny McCormack after the 1997 split of The Wildhearts. Although signed and promoted heavily, the band never really took off, and they too split after recording a debut album.\n\nDuring this time, Andy had been working with Raymond Watts (also known as PIG) and had toured Japan with the band. Realizing that he was not going to get the gigs he needed if he stayed in London, he moved to the United States, where his working partnership with Watts led to his inclusion in the lineup of KMFDM. He occasionally performs with punk band Dwarves under the alias Dutch Ovens. In late 2007, Selway played the drums for the Seattle rock band DragStrip Riot and Japanese pop star Ayumi Hamasaki in her songs \"Talkin' 2 Myself\" and \"Decision\".\n\nIn 2008, he went on tour with Genitorturers. In 2009, he toured with his KMFDM bandmate Jules Hodgson's new band, The Spittin' Cobras.\n\nHe resides in West Palm Beach with his wife, Christee Carter, and son.",
  "Llandyssil\n\nLlandyssil is a village in Powys, Wales, about two miles from the town of Montgomery.\n\nThe village is part of the Llandyssil community. In 2001 there were 420 inhabitants in the parish, of whom 300 lived in the village itself.\n\nConnection with Celtic saints\n\nLlandyssil takes its name from St Tysul, a little known Welsh saint of the 7th century AD. Only two churches in Wales were dedicated to this saint, Llandyssil in Montgomeryshire and Llandysul in Ceredigion, and the feast day for this saint was celebrated on 31 January. The old church in the village (largely demolished in 1866) stood in the graveyard to the SE of the present village. This suggests that the present settlement dates back to the period around 700AD. There is also a connection with another early Welsh and Breton saint, St Padarn. On the highland to the south in Cefn y Coed is the farm Cwm Badarn. The Llandyssil Brook rises in this Cwm or valley, and between Cwm Badarn Farm and the Pinion is a rock cut spring, that was possibly a Holy Well, dedicated to St Padarn.\n\nHistory\n\nIn the Medieval period, Llandyssil was in the Cantref of Cedewain in the Kingdom of Powys. The parish was divided into four townships: Bolbro, Bronywood (or Bronycoed), Bryntalch and Rhandir. Rhandir, which contained the parish church, was the largest of these townships. It was probably an amalgamation of three other townships; Cefn-y-coed, Coedywig and Trefganol. In 1536, following the Act of Union, Llandyssil became part of the new county of Montgomeryshire. For ecclesiastical administration, the parish was in the Bishopric of St Asaph, the Archdeaconry of Montgomery and the Deanery of Cedewain. For Parliamentary representation, Llandyssil fell within the County of Montgomery until 1885, when, for electoral purposes, it was included within the Montgomery Boroughs. It was transferred back to the County in 1918, when only one MP represented Montgomeryshire. With the establishment of the Montgomeryshire County Council in 1894, Llandyssil Parish Council was created, and it was included in Forden Rural District Council. In 1974, as a result of Local Government reform, Llandyssil Parish Council became a Community Council within the Montgomeryshire District Council. At this time, Llanmerewig was joined with Llandyssil to form the new Community Council, and in 1984 this was renamed Abermule with Llandyssil Community Council. At this time, the Community Council covered the old parishes of Llanmerewig and Llandyssil, together with Dolforwyn, which had been a township in Bettws Cedewain parish. In 1996, with the abolition of the Montgomeryshire District Council, the Community Council became part of Powys County Council.\n\nPopulation and language\n\nThe Census returns are as follows:\n\nIn 1880 a portion of the township of Bolbro was transferred from Llandyssil to Llanmerewig and the size of the parish was reduced from 4187 acres to 3800 acres. This may be reflected in the decrease in population between the 1881 and 1891 censuses.\n\nDuring the later part of the 18th century, it appears that the Welsh language was supplanted by English for general usage in the village. There are some Welsh speakers in the village, but they have mainly come from elsewhere in Montgomeryshire.\n\nArchaeological and historic monuments\n\nLlandyssil is particularly rich in archaeological sites, especially of the Later Bronze Age and Iron Age. To the NE it is overshadowed by Ffridd Faldwyn, possibly the largest Hillfort in Wales, which is adjacent to Town Hill in Montgomery. Most of the sites have been discovered by aerial photography. The main sites are:\n\nQuoiting\n\nPlaying quoits was a widespread pastime in many rural areas. It had largely died in much of England by the 2nd World War, but after the War enjoyed a revival in Mid-Wales, when the quoits were made by a light engineering company in Newtown. In Llandyssil the \u201cOld\u201d or Long quoits rules were followed. The quoits court was moved to behind the Upper House Public House by 1983, when an international game was played between Wales and Scotland. The Welsh team was captained by Glyn Owen of Llandyssil, and other village players were Les Owen and George Mills. The Welsh team lost to Scotland. In the 1991 International match at Llandyssil, when Les Owen was in the team, Wales convincingly beat Scotland 252 to 83. The last championship match was held at Llandyssil in 2003, after which the court was closed. It is to be hoped that the sport might be revived in Llandyssil in the future.\n\nSheep Dog Trials\n\nThe 2012 Welsh National Sheep Dog Trials were held on the field by Llandyssil bridge at Henfron, Llandyssil, between 19 and 21 July 2012.",
  "Richard Reading, CdeG(B)\n\nRichard Reading CdeG(B) (1876\u20131929) was an English journalist, baritone and Chevalier of the Order of Leopold.\n\nEarly life and career\n\nRichard Reading was born in Bury, Lancashire and was the son of T. Reading, of Warwickshire, England. Reading was educated in Birmingham. A well-regarded sports journalist, Reading rose to prominence writing for Manchester's \"Sporting Chronicle\", acted as the sporting editor for Manchester's \"Daily Sketch\" and was president of the Manchester Press Club. Reading was a friend and contemporary of the war correspondent Sir Basil Clarke and became the subject of Clarke's first important correspondence from the front.\n\nBelgian service and the First World War\n\nAt the outbreak of the First World War, the British army rejected Reading because he was over its age limit. Undeterred, Reading as part of the Manchester Troop of the Legion of Frontiersmen travelled to Belgium. There he initially enlisted with the 3rd Belgian Lancers in the early stages of the war and was soon promoted to the rank of corporal. He transferred to a Minerva Armored Car unit, the Corps de Mitrailleuses under Count Pierre de Lunden, that was active at both the Belgian and French Fronts. It was Reading's actions in this capacity that saw him awarded the Belgian Croix de Guerre and made a Chevalier of the Order of Leopold. An account of his heroism follows.\n\nReading had been on a scouting expedition with his armoured car unit when he identified an advance guard of the German army. The Germans had set up an ambush and opened fire. Reading was able to warn the other four men of the unit, instructing them to save themselves and the armoured car and not to worry about him. Under gunfire, the car moved off at speed. For a quarter of a mile, the occupants were unaware that Reading had grasped on to the back of the car and was being dragged. Reading had been shot in both legs by German expanding bullets and had also sustained significant injuries from being dragged at speed. Despite his wounds, he was described by a nurse as coming \"in on a stretcher bright as a button, smoking a cigar and laughing\". Reading required multiple surgeries and spent two years at Worsley New Hall convalescing from the wounds he sustained in this skirmish that left him needing the aid of crutches to walk. Reading's casual bravado \"encapsulated the spirit of adventure-seeking that was typical of the attitudes of many Britons during the early part of the war\".\n\nPost-war life\n\nFollowing his recuperation, Reading sailed to Australia on the P & O Line's \"Mongolia\" to join his two brothers George and Frederick in Bangalow, New South Wales. During the sea journey, the \"Mongolia\" struck a German mine and sank off the coast of Mumbai (then called Bombay) in 1917 with the loss of 23 lives. Reading, badly injured by shrapnel from the explosion, survived the sinking. A cabin mate rescued him before the ship sank. There are reports of an extended time at sea before the survivors reached land. Reading was then carried on a stretcher by locals to the closest township and was further hospitalized for 6 months in Bombay. His survival had achieved some notoriety seeing Reading dubbed \"The Man Who Would Not Die\".\n\nOn his eventual arrival in Australia, Reading initially settled in Brunswick Heads, New South Wales. Reading worked in oyster culture in the region for 5 years. During this time, he married Mary Drusilla Taylor on 8 July 1920 at the Church of St Mary Ballina. Taylor was the daughter of the late Thomas Taylor; a grazier of Graham's Valley, Glencoe and was matron of Byron Hospital, Bangalow. Taylor had been a nurse in Belgium during the war. Reading contributed to the community in the area. He organised local sporting events, wrote occasional newspaper articles under the moniker \"Chev\"  and compiled a local publication on Brunswick Heads. Reading rekindled his singing and was a popular baritone participating in the local social and cultural life. He performed for patriotic and charitable concerts in the Richmond River district and successfully competed in local eisteddfodau in Armidale, New South Wales and Queensland.\n\nFollowing medical advice, Reading ceased oyster cultivation. Reading and his wife left for Melbourne when he gained a position as sub-editor for the sporting section of The Herald. He worked there for approximately 18 months until shortly before his death in 1929 aged 53. He maintained his interest in singing as a member of the St Paul's Cathedral Choir. The Choir paid special tribute to Reading during his memorial service, draping his seat with both the Union Jack and the Belgian Flag. A Belgian wreath was placed on his coffin by Rev. R. Sherwood, Precentor of St. Paul's, for the Belgian Consul General \"as a token of gratitude from the Belgian nation for a gallant and brave soldier \". Sir Basil Clarke wrote an obituary that was published both in the London \"Daily News\" and the \"Northern Star\", Lismore, NSW. On 22 September 1929, in accordance with his last wishes, Reading's ashes were scattered three-quarters of a mile off the breakwater of the Richmond River near to Reading's Bay by Captain Upward of the \"Milora\". During the Independence Centenary commemoration in Brussels in 1930, his widow was presented to the King and Queen of Belgium. In 1940 Byron Shire Council accepted, from the estate of Reading's widow, a legacy of \u00a3100 together with the Reading's property \"Calgarth\" at Brunswick Heads. She had left the legacy for the creation of a bird sanctuary and memorial to her late husband. The council later sold the asset.",
  "Aviadvigatel PD-14\n\nThe Aviadvigatel PD-14 (previously known as PS-12) is a high-bypass turbofan being developed by Aviadvigatel to power the Irkut MC-21 twin-jet airliner. It is a 14 tf (30,865 lbf) thrust powerplant.\n\nDevelopment\n\nIn December 2009, the PD-14 was developed to be 15% more efficient than its PS-90A2 predecessor to be installed on the MS-21 and the Ilyushin Il-276.\n\nThe PD-14 was announced in early 2010 with its development cost estimated at RUB 35 billion (US$1.1 billion). In April 2010, Aviadvigatel was expecting to start its certification procedure in 2012. Its core was first tested on 26 November 2010. It was displayed for the first time at the 2013 MAKS air show.\n\nFlight tests began in 2015 on an Ilyushin Il-76. Between December 2016 and May 2017, the PD-14 operational performance and working efficiency at all altitudes and speeds were assessed on the Il-76 testbed aircraft at Gromov Flight Research Institute near Moscow. After two years exploring performance at most altitudes, airspeeds and operating modes, the first and second testing stages confirmed its basic operating parameters. A third phase of flight tests debuted in January 2018 from the GFRI Zhukovsky Airfield, conducted in co-operation with certification specialists to formally confirm the pre-certification efforts findings.\n\nGround tests will continue in parallel, and United Engine Corporation claims that the engine matches the performance of products from foreign competitors and surpasses them for noise and emissions. Bird strike tests on the fan, including high-speed video and vibration measurements, were conducted together with fan blade strength tests. The successful results are expected to reduce the time and cost of attaining full certification status.\n\nUnited Engine will deliver five PD-14s to Irkut by the end of 2018, after Rosaviatsia certification, to start flight tests on the MC-21 in 2019 for type certification of the variant in 2021. EASA certification is expected when it will enter series production. In October 2018, Rosaviatsia granted certification to the PD-14, and deliveries of the first engines for two MC-21s are expected by the end of 2018. European certificate validation is planned for 2019.\n\nIn October 2021, the engine successfully passed landmark volcanic ash exposure test. According to Anatoly Serdyukov, the thrust of the PD-14 \u201cpractically did not decrease\u201d after the engine was exposed to the presence of the ash for 1 hour.\n\nDesign\n\nThe 1.9 m (75 in) fan has 18 titanium alloy blades, providing an 8.5:1 bypass ratio significantly improved from previous Russian engines, but below the CFM LEAP's 10:1 or the Pratt & Whitney PW1000G's 12:1 for the MC-21 from 2017. The 3D aerodynamics shaped first high-pressure turbine stage has advanced cooling channels. Twenty new materials were developed for the powerplant, including monocrystalline alloys for vanes, and high-strength nickel and titanium alloys for shafts and disks.\n\nDeveloped from the PS-12 (an uprated PS-90A), the 122\u2013153 kN (27,500-34,500 lbf) thrust powerplant is designed by Aviadvigatel and manufactured by the Perm Engine Company. The two-shaft turbofan has a high-pressure core from the PS-12 with an eight-stage compressor and a two-stage turbine, and four low-pressure stages. The high-bypass engine does not employ an exhaust mixer, fuel burn should be reduced by 10\u201315% from the CFM International CFM56 and it could power an upgraded Tupolev Tu-204.\n\nPD-35\n\nLaunched in the summer of 2016 by United Engine Corporation through Aviadvigatel and NPO Saturn, the 35 tf thrust PD-35 will be developed till 2025 for 180 billion rubles ($3 billion) including 60 billion for test benches and laboratory equipment, to power future wide-body aircraft including the Russo-Chinese CRAIC CR929. The 8 m long engine will weigh 8 t, its fan will be 3.1 m in diameter and its scaled up PD-14 core will have a nine-stage high-pressure compressor and two-stage turbine.\n\nOn 19 January 2018, the Russian government awarded UEC-Aviadvigatel a \u20bd64.3 billion ($1.13 billion) contract to develop a PD-35-1 demonstrator by 2023, including wide-chord composite fan blades and fan case, a 23:1 compressor pressure ratio, ceramic matrix composites \u2013 silicon carbide-silicon carbide (SiC-SiC) and carbon-silicon carbide (C-SiC) \u2013 and advanced cooling for 1,450 \u00b0C (2,640 \u00b0F) temperatures. It could power the Ilyushin IL-96-400, the Il-76 airlifter, Il-78 tanker and an Antonov An-124 replacement Ilyushin Il-106 PAK VTA. A de-rated version would meet the An-124 thrust requirements.",

  "Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)\n\nThe Kingdom of Serbia (\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0459\u0435\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0430 / Kraljevina Srbija), or the Serbian Kingdom (\u0421\u0440\u043f\u0441\u043a\u043e \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0459\u0435\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e / Srpsko kraljevstvo), was a medieval Serbian state that existed from 1217 to 1346 and was ruled by the Nemanji\u0107 dynasty. The Grand Principality of Serbia was elevated with the regal coronation of Stefan Nemanji\u0107 as king, after the reunification of Serbian lands. In 1219, Serbian Orthodox Church was reorganized as an autocephalous archbishopric, headed by Saint Sava. The kingdom was proclaimed an empire in 1346, but kingship was not abolished as an institution, since the title of a king was used as an official designation for a co-ruler of the emperor.\n\nBackground\n\nThe regal coronation of Stefan Nemanji\u0107 in 1217 was not a novelty in Serbian history, since there had already been a long tradition of kingship among previous Serbian rulers, centered in Duklja (11th century). During the Nemanji\u0107 era, the previous Serbian kingdom in Duklja was referred to as the \"Old Kingdom of our forefathers\" and such views were also reflected in the royal titles of Stefan Nemanji\u0107 and his successors, who styled themselves as kings of all Serbian Lands, including Duklja. Realizing the importance of royal heritage, grand prince Stefan Nemanja (1166-1196), father of Stefan Nemanji\u0107, granted his elder son Vukan Nemanji\u0107 rule in Duklja, with the title of king.\n\nBy that time, the \"Old Kingdom\" of Duklja and its former rulers from the Vojislavljevi\u0107 dynasty (kings Mihajlo and Constantine Bodin) were regarded as royal predecessors to the Nemanji\u0107 dynasty, that branched from the previous Vukanovi\u0107 dynasty in Ra\u0161ka. Older relations between the two dynasties (Vojislavljevi\u0107 / Vukanovi\u0107) and the two regions (Duklja / Ra\u0161ka) were very close. In 1083, king Constantine Bodin of Duklja appointed his nephews Vukan and Marko vassals in Ra\u0161ka, one of the inner provinces of his realm. Each province had its own nobility and institutions, and each acquired a member or relative of the Vojislavljevi\u0107 dynasty to govern as \u017eupan. Between 1089 and 1091, the Byzantine Empire launched a campaign on Duklja. An internal war broke out in the realm among Bodin's relatives, greatly weakening Duklja. Vukan of Ra\u0161ka took the opportunity to assert himself and broke away, claiming the title of Grand Prince of Serbia.\n\nUp to the end of the 11th century, Duklja had been the center of the Serbian realm, as well as the main state resisting Byzantium. From that time, Ra\u0161ka became the most powerful of the Serbian states, under the rule of the Vukanovi\u0107 dynasty, and it remained so throughout the entire 12th century. Ra\u0161ka also replaced Duklja as the main opponent of the Byzantine Empire. Bodin's heirs were forced to recognize Byzantine overlordship, and now held only the small territories of Duklja and Travunia. During the reign of Vukan's successors, the Byzantines sought to conquer Ra\u0161ka on several occasions, but through resistance, and diplomatic ties with Hungary, that Serbian principality kept its independence. By the time when Stefan Nemanja became the grand \u017eupan of Ra\u0161ka (c. 1166), old Duklja was half conquered by the Byzantines reduced to a small principality. Soon after 1180, Stefan Nemanja liberated Duklja thus reuniting Serbian lands, and invested his son Vukan with rule over Duklja with the traditional title of the king. Since Nemanja's second son Stefan became grand \u017eupan in 1196, rivalry occurred among brothers, culminating in 1202 when Stefan was overthrown.\n\nReign of Stefan the First-Crowned\n\nIn 1204, Stefan Nemanji\u0107 regained his rule in Ra\u0161ka and made peace with his brother Vukan of Duklja, who died in 1208. The actual peacemaker was their youngest brother Rastko, former prince of Zahumlje who renounced his rule to become a monk, and took the name Sava, turning all his efforts to spreading Eastern Orthodoxy among his people. Since the Roman Catholic Church already had ambitions to spread its influence to Southeastern Europe as well, Stefan used these circumstances to eventually obtain the recognition of kingship from the Pope, thereby becoming Serbian king in 1217. In Byzantium, Sava managed to secure autocephaly (independence) for the Serbian Church and became the first Serbian archbishop in 1219. In the same year Sava published the first constitution in Serbia \u2014 St. Sava's Nomocanon (Zakonopravilo). The Nomocanon was a compilation of Civil law, based on Roman Law, and Canon law, based on Ecumenical Councils. Its basic purpose was to organize the functions of the young Serbian kingdom and the Serbian church. Thus the Serbs acquired both political and religious independence. In 1220, grand assembly of the realm was held in \u017di\u010da, were Stefan was crowned by the Orthodox ritual and coronation was performed by archbishop Sava. That act served as a precedent for all their successors: all Serbian kings of the Nemanji\u0107 dynasty were crowned in \u017di\u010da, by Serbian archbishops.\n\nReign of Radoslav, Vladislav, Uro\u0161 I and Dragutin\n\nThe next generation of Serbian rulers \u2014 the sons of Stefan Prvoven\u010dani, Radoslav, Vladislav, and Uro\u0161 I \u2014 marked a period of stagnation of the state structure. All three kings were more or less dependent on some of the neighbouring states \u2014 Byzantium, Bulgaria, or Hungary. The ties with the Hungarians played a decisive role as Uro\u0161 I was succeeded by his son Dragutin, whose wife was a Hungarian princess. Later, when Dragutin abdicated in favour of his younger brother Milutin, in 1282, the Hungarian king Ladislaus IV gave him lands in northeastern Bosnia, the region of Ma\u010dva, and the city of Belgrade, whilst he managed to conquer and annex lands in northeastern Serbia. Thus, some of these territories became part of the Serbian state for the first time. His new state was named Kingdom of Srem. In that time the name Srem was a designation for two territories: Upper Srem (present day Srem) and Lower Srem (present day Ma\u010dva). The Kingdom of Srem under the rule of Stefan Dragutin was actually Lower Srem, but some historical sources mention that Stefan Dragutin also ruled over Upper Srem and Slavonia. After Dragutin died in 1316, his son, king Vladislav II, became king and ruled until 1325.\n\nReign of Milutin\n\nUnder Dragutin's younger brother, King Milutin, Serbia grew stronger despite having to occasionally fight wars on three different fronts. King Milutin was an apt diplomat much inclined to the use of a customary medieval diplomatic and dynastic marriages. He was married five times, with Hungarian, Bulgarian, and Byzantine princesses. He is also famous for building churches, some of which are the finest examples of Medieval Serbian architecture, including the Gra\u010danica monastery in Kosovo, the Cathedral in Hilandar monastery on Mount Athos, and the St. Archangel Church in Jerusalem. Because of his endowments, King Milutin has been proclaimed a saint, in spite of his tumultuous life. He was succeeded on the throne by his son Stefan, later dubbed Stefan De\u010danski.\n\nMilutin restored central royal authority in Serbia. After getting into power, he started lengthy attacks on Byzantine Macedonia, winning significant territorial gains, including the city of Skopje, move that had important results. The strategically important region of Macedonia was disputed for long between Byzantines, Bulgarians and Serbs. The expansion into the area marked the start of Serbian dominance in the Balkans. By this, Serbian policy shifted from its original north-western Adriatic-Danubian focus, into Byzantine-centered south-central Balkans. By acquiring Skopje, Milutin's kingdom possessed a strategically located, well-fortified city that could serve as capital to a territorially extensive state. Its central geo-strategical position on the important Vardar-Morava commercial route made it a natural new political, economical and cultural center. Skopje's benefits, combined with Serbia's flourishing mining and trade resources, guaranteed Milutin a status as a major player in Balkan affairs.\n\nAlthough the major events were happening in the South, Milutin also devoted attention in Serbian affairs in the North. With his deposed brother Dragutin governing the Belgrade region, the two brothers acted in concert as military allies, Dragutin helping Milutin in the South and vice versa. By early 1290s Serbia expanded towards the vicinity of Vidin. Threatened by Serbian expansion, Shishman of Vidin failed to repel the brothers forces, and accepted Serbian suzerainty.\n\nIn the South, Milut",

  "Patterson High School (Baltimore)\n\nPatterson High School (formerly known as Patterson Park High School) is a public high school located in the Hopkins-Bayview neighborhood in Baltimore, Maryland, United States.\n\nAcademics\n\nPatterson High School gained media attention in 2022 when a report showed 75 percent of students tested at the school were reading and doing math an elementary school level. The school's attendance rate was 59 percent, compared to the district average of 80 percent, and dropout rate was 29 percent, with a college enrollment rate of 21 percent, meaning \"more students quit school than enroll in higher education\". Maryland Governor Larry Hogan commented, \"Baltimore City School system is not doing a great job educating the kids...I was disgusted by it\".\n\nOverview\n\nPatterson High School is a comprehensive high school with approximately 1200 students, grades nine through twelve. The lead principal is Mr. Vance Benton, 1st African American to hold the position in the school's history. Patterson no longer operates as academies, but instead as a cohort model. Students are divided into cohorts based on their year of expected graduation.\n\nEach cohort is led by a lead principal with a dedicated cohort counselor. The class of 2020's lead principal is Ernestine Edler, the class of 2021 is led by Aaron Hippolyte, the class of 2022 by Maxwell Aukwu, while the class of 2023 is led by Christian Licier. Patterson is designated as the Career Center school for Baltimore's East Side. The school is a social emotional learning, student wholeness site that offers multiple pathways in Career and Technology Education (CTE); Patterson students take pathway courses during their tenth, eleventh, and twelfth grade years, in addition to Maryland State Graduation Requirements, University of Maryland Systems requirements, and a wide variety of elective courses. Pathways at Patterson for the 2019\u201320 school year include:\n\nPatterson has a diverse student population. The ESOL Program has both Emergent and Newcomers Program and support for ESOL students throughout their integrated classes by offering mentoring and partnerships with Liberty's Promise and Refugee Youth Program.\n\nIn 2012 a Patterson student won first place in the Baltimore City Math Bowl.\n\nPatterson High School is the assumed school which Hairspray\u2019s main character, Tracy Turnblad, goes to.\n\nAthletics\n\nIn 1993, Patterson, along with all the other Baltimore City public schools, left the Maryland Scholastic Association (MSA) to join the Maryland Public Secondary Schools Athletic Association (MPSSAA). The move meant that Baltimore City Public Schools would be able to compete with the rest of the state's public schools in a variety of sports arenas. Since the move, the Clippers have been to the state semi-finals in 1994, 1999, 2004 and to the quarter-finals in 1993, 1995, 1996, 1998 and 2001.",

  "Miwok mythology\n\nThe mythology of the Miwok Native Americans are myths of their world order, their creation stories and 'how things came to be' created. Miwok myths suggest their spiritual and philosophical world view. In several different creation stories collected from Miwok people, Coyote was seen as their ancestor and creator god, sometimes with the help of other animals, forming the earth and making people out of humble materials like feathers or twigs.\n\nAccording to Miwok mythology, the people believed in animal and human spirits, and spoke of animal spirits as their ancestors. Coyote in many tales figures as their ancestor, creator god, and a trickster god. The Miwok mythology is similar to other Native American myths of Northern California.\n\nFirst People\n\nThe Miwok believed there existed a \"people who lived before real people\" who in some tales have died out, in others are the same as the supernatural animal spirits.\n\nSeveral creation fragments exist detailing Coyote's place in the family of the \"first spirits\" on earth. According to the Coast Miwok, Coyote was the declared grandfather of the Falcon. There existed animal spirits and a few star-people spirits. From the Sacramento river area the Miwok gave the following names of the first spirits:\n\nCoast Miwok (Coyote and Walik)\n\nAccording to one Coast Miwok version \"Coyote shook his walik\" (something similar to a blanket of tule) to the four directions south, east, north and west. The water dried, and land appeared.\n\nThe Diver\n\nIn one creation myth called The Diver Coyote creates the earth and land from the Ocean or endless water. Coyote sends a turtle to dive into the Ocean for some \"earth\". The turtle dives to the bottom and comes up with some \"earth\". Coyote takes the earth and mixes it with \"Chanit\" seeds and water. The mixture swells and \"the earth was there.\"\n\nCoyote and Silver Fox\n\nAnother creation story says that there is \"no earth, only water\". Silver Fox (a vixen) feels lonely and mentions this in a prayer song, and then meets the Coyote. Silver Fox makes an artistic proposal: \"We will sing the world\". They create the world together by dancing and singing. As they do so, the earth forms and takes shape.\n\nCoast Miwok (Coyote and Turkey Buzzard)\n\nIn The Creation of Humans myth, Coyote catches a turkey buzzard, raven and crow, plucks their feathers and place the feathers in different parts of the earth. They turn into the Miwok people and their villages.\n\nCoast Miwok (Coyote and Chicken Hawk)\n\nCoyote comes from the west alone, followed by Chicken Hawk, who is his grandson. Coyote turned \"his first people\" into animals. He made the Pomo people from mud and the Miwok people out of sticks.\n\nSierra Miwok (How ravens became people)\n\nIn the myth How Kah'-kah-loo The Ravens Became People, there was an epic flood, and the first world people climbed a mountain to avoid drowning. The water finally receded. They were starving, they thought it was safe to come down and look for food but they sank into the mud and died. The ravens came to sit on the holes where the people died, one raven at each hole. The ravens turned into new people the Miwok.\n\nSierra Miwok (Coyote and Lizard)\n\nFrom the Sierra Miwoks, another creation myth is more comparable to Pomo mythology: Coyote and Lizard create the world \"and everything in it\". Coyote create human beings from some twigs. They argue over whether human beings should have hands. Lizard wants humans to have hands but Coyote does not. Lizard wins a scuffle, and humans are created with hands.\n\nCoast Miwok (Ocean Path West)\n\nAccording to Coast Miwok, the dead jumped into the ocean at Point Reyes and followed something like a string leading west beyond the breaker waves, that took them to the setting sun. There they remained with Coyote in an afterworld \"ute-yomigo\" or \"ute-yomi\", meaning \"dead home.\"\n\nContext\n\nMany of the ideas, plots and characters in Miwok mythology are shared with neighboring people of Northern California. For example, the Coyote-lizard story is like the tale told by their neighbors, the Pomo people. In addition, the Ohlone also believed that Coyote was the grandfather of the Falcon and maker of mankind. The relationship and similarity to Yokuts traditional narratives is also evident.\n\nThe myths of creation after an epic flood or ocean, the Earth Diver, and the Coyote as ancestor and trickster compare to Central and Northern California mythemes of Yokuts mythology, Ohlone mythology and Pomo mythology. The myths of \"First People\" dying out to be replaced with the Miwok people is a \"deeply impressed conception\" shared by Natives in Northwestern California.",

  "Soundwave (Transformers) Soundwave is a fictional character appearing in various Transformers continuities within the Transformers franchise. His most well-known disguise is that of a micro cassette recorder. Throughout most of his incarnations, he is an underlying loyal lieutenant of the Decepticon leader Megatron. He is commonly depicted as Megatron's communications officer and, in some interpretations, only speaks when mocking the Autobots. Transformers: Generation 1 Soundwave is one of the characters from the original Transformers line. His alternate mode is a microcassette recorder and he has a distinctive monotone, computerized voice. Soundwave is able to detect and jam transmissions across the entire energy spectrum, a talent that makes him suited to his position as a Deception Communications Officer. Additionally, he has a photographic memory on account of the data storage capacity of the magnetic disks in his chest compartment, and he is armed with a shoulder-mounted laser cannon and hand-held concussion blaster. Soundwave is physically strong compared to most Transformers. His alternative form is that of an Earthly microcassette deck. Within the tape compartment, which becomes his chest in robot mode, he stores a variety of Decepticon spies, all of which take the alternative form of a microcassette. These spy characters include Ravage, Laserbeak, Buzzsaw, Ratbat, Rumble, Frenzy, Slugfest, Wingthing, Autoscout and Overkill, all of whom are under Soundwave's command in the original television series. Squawktalk and Beastbox were additional cassette characters under Soundwave's control in the US toyline, who were never shown in the cartoon. Soundwave's cassettes are quick to serve and defend Soundwave in a crisis, and generally relate to him as servants or even pets. However, when his cassette Ratbat became leader of the Decepticons in the Marvel Comics series, Soundwave fully shifted his trademark loyalty from Megatron to him. In the Dreamwave comics, Ratbat led the Ultracons faction, while Soundwave remained with the Decepticons led by Shockwave, although within that continuity these events occurred before Ratbat took up a cassette form. In the IDW comics, on pre-war Cybertron Soundwave functioned as personal assistant to Ratbat, who was a Senator at the time, however, Soundwave's true loyalty lay with Megatron. When the time came for him and Starscream to massacre the Senate, he enslaved Ratbat by bestowing the smaller, weaker cassette body upon him. Reception According to X-Entertainment, Soundwave was one of the top Transformers figures of all time. Animated series In the original Transformers cartoon, Soundwave was Megatron's right-hand mech, frequently sent on important reconnaissance missions with his cassettes, and often playing a key role in many schemes against the Autobots. On Cybertron, he used his ability to transform into a lamp-post to spy on the Autobot city of Lacon, learning of the Autobots' plan to search for energy on other worlds. Joining in Megatron's attack on the Autobot's craft, the Arc, Soundwave fell to the same fate as the rest of the ship's occupants when the craft crashed on prehistoric Earth, entombing everyone within stasis. Immediately after the Transformers awakened on Earth in 1984, Soundwave played an essential role in the generation of energon cubes and the formation of plans for a new space cruiser to return the Decepticons to Cybertron. Later, he used his mind-reading talents to acquire an antimatter formula for the Decepticons from the brain of Chip Chase. He and his cassette minions were often on spying missions against the Autobots. One of Soundwave's most notable misadventures came in season 2 when, operating a plan conceived by Starscream, he brainwashed humans with ultrasonic vibrations, leading to a confrontation with his Autobot Communications Officer counterpart, Blaster, and to a lasting rivalry between the two. Soundwave rarely displayed much emotion, infrequently exhibiting any traits that could be considered to be in line with his tech spec. However, he showed distress when one of his cassettes were hurt in battle, and he always came across as extremely loyal to Megatron, even going so far as to recover his body after beaten close to death by Optimus Prime at the battle of Autobot City in 2005 (The Transformers: The Movie). But while Soundwave was loyal, he was far from outspoken, and kept silent when Megatron's body was subsequently ejected into space, and although he did suggest himself as a replacement leader (\"Soundwave: superior. Constructicons: inferior.\"), Soundwave again loyally served Megatron when he was reformatted as Galvatron. In season 3, although operating in a less prominent capacity for most of the time, Soundwave played a prominent role in Galvatron's attempt to learn the secret of a sonic weapon on the planet Eurythma, where sound and music were the way of life, leaving Soundwave entranced by the planet's perfect melodies. Recording each piece of the harmony that formed the devastating sonic effect, Soundwave was defeated when the Eurythmans countered the harmony with white noise, and was again pulled into a confrontation with Blaster, who erased his recordings. Soundwave made his final appearance in the American cartoon series, the Season 3 finale The Return of Optimus Prime, Part 1 as he was only seen giving the latest piece of information gathered by Ratbat that two scientists had discovered Optimus Prime's body which made Galvatron eager destroy it once and for all. Although Soundwave only appeared as a background character in the American cartoon series finale, the three-part The Rebirth, he returned to the forefront in the new Japanese-exclusive series, Transformers: The Headmasters, which was created to replace The Rebirth. Reborn as Soundblaster (New Soundwave in the English version and Vizar in Italy) Soundwave's new toy incarnation was, like the series, available only in Japan. In the 1987 anime robot superhero TV series Transformers: The Headmasters, Soundwave and Blaster's rivalry had increased dramatically. In the opening cut and thrust of Headmasters, Soundwave and Blaster engaged in their final clash in the Arctic Circle as the Autobots and Decepticons were in the process of searching for the missing Autobot Matrix of Leadership. The two opponents inflicted fatal damage to each other, and Soundwave's body exploded even as Blaster collapsed. Soundwave's fragments were recovered by his cassettes. Using reconstructive technology from the planet Master, the leader of the Decepticon Headmasters, Zarak successfully rebuilt and resurrected Soundwave and renamed him Soundblaster\u2014essentially identical to his former self, except for his predominantly black color scheme. As Soundblaster, he served the same role as he had as Soundwave under the leadership of Galvatron and later Scorponok, frequently embarking on spying missions with Ratbat. In Headmasters, his character was somewhat changed to have a father-son relationship with the cassettes, as it was hinted on his resurrection as Soundblaster. Soundwave was performed by Frank Welker, whose voice was heavily modulated by a vocoder to achieve Soundwave's distinctive, metallic monotone. However, Welker's voice was left unmodulated at certain points during the episodes \"Roll for It\" and \"Webworld\" due to production errors. This left him sounding like Dr. Claw, another role Welker performed, from Inspector Gadget. Books Soundwave appeared in the following books: 3H Enterprises He also appeared in the Furman written Reaching the Omega Point, as one of the Transformers legends (alongside Optimus Prime, Megatron and Grimlock) who came to the aid of the forces of Optimus Primal against the Predacon/Unicron hybrid Shokaract, distracting him long enough for Primus to deal the fatal blow. Devil's Due Publishing In Devil's Due's run of G.I. Joe vs. the Transformers comic book miniseries, Soundwave was among the Transformers captured by the ruthless terrorist Cobra Organization, when they discovered the Ark. Refitted by Destro, Soundwave was intended to become a battlefield communications station, but when he and the other Decepticons eventually broke free of their control he was damaged in a battle with the Autobots and his parts were captured by the US Government for study. From his data banks, the android SerpentO.R. downloaded information on the history of Cybertron, using it to further the Decepticon goal of conquest. It is indicated that his pre-Earth form was similar to his Dreamwave War Within form. Dreamwave Productions In Dreamwave's 21st century re-imagining of the Generation 1 continuity, Soundwave was recruited to the Decepticons 9 million years ago through Megatron's underground gladiatorial games, and made head of communications. When a new Autobot leader, Optimus Prime, was chosen, Soundwave was sent along with the Insecticons and Ravage, to attempt to kill him and recover the Autobot Matrix of Leadership for Megatron, but they failed, forcing Megatron to confront Optimus personally. Even in the face of failures such as this, and later the loss of Megatron in an early space bridge experiment, Soundwave's loyalty to the Decepticon cause never wavered, as he remained true to the faction under Shockwave's leadership. As in most other continuities, the story continues in the traditional manner, with Soundwave a member of the Nemesis crew who attacked the Ark and was sent into stasis when the craft crashed on Earth",
  "Italian destroyer Carlo Mirabello\n\nCarlo Mirabello was one of three s built for the Regia Marina (Royal Italian Navy) during World War I.\n\nDesign and description\n\nThe ships were designed as scout cruisers (esploratori), essentially enlarged versions of contemporary destroyers. They had an overall length of 103.75 m, a beam of 9.74 m and a mean draft of 3.3 m. They displaced 1784 t at standard load, and 2040 t at deep load. Their complement was 8 officers and 161 enlisted men.\n\nThe Mirabellos were powered by two Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft using steam supplied by four Yarrow boilers. The turbines were rated at 44000 shp for a speed of 35 kn and Carlo Mirabello reached a speed of 33.74 kn from 44026 shp during her sea trials. The ships carried enough fuel oil to give them a range of 2300 nmi at a speed of 12 kn.\n\nTheir main battery consisted of eight Cannone da 102 mm/35 S Modello 1914 guns in single mounts protected by gun shields, one each fore and aft of the superstructure on the centerline and the remaining guns positioned on the broadside amidships. Carlo Mirabello exchanged a Cannone da 152 mm/40 A Modello 1891 for the forward 102 mm gun; Carlo Mirabello received hers in 1917. The gun proved to be too heavy for the ships and its rate of fire was too slow. Anti-aircraft (AA) defense for the Mirabello-class ships was provided by a pair of 40-caliber Cannone da 76 mm/40 Modello 1916 AA guns in single mounts. They were equipped with four 450 mm torpedo tubes in two twin mounts, one on each broadside. The ship could also carry 100 mines.\n\nModifications\n\nThe 152 mm gun proved to be too heavy for the ships and its rate of fire was too slow so it was replaced when the Mirabello-class ships were rearmed with eight 45-caliber Cannone da 102/45 S, A Modello 1917 guns arranged as per Carlo Mirabellos original configuration in 1919. The 76 mm guns were replaced by a pair of 39-caliber Cannone da 40 mm/39 AA guns in single mounts in 1920\u20131922.",
  "47th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)\n\nThe 47th Infantry Division (47. Infanterie-Division) was an infantry division of the German Heer during World War II. It was formed in February 1944 and was destroyed by the forces of the Western Allies in the Mons cauldron in September 1944. The division was then reassembled as the 47th Volksgrenadier Division and operated until 1945.\n\nOperational history\n\nThe 47th Infantry Division was raised on 1 February 1944 near Calais in German-occupied France from the 156th Reserve Division. The process of reclassification of the 156th Reserve Division had started on 23 November 1943. Subsequently, the 47th Infantry Division was assigned to coastal defense duty against the possibility of a naval invasion by the Western Allies. When this invasion became reality in the form of Operation Overlord, starting with the D-day landings on 6 June 1944, the 47th Infantry Division under command of Otto Elfeldt, was assigned to 5th Panzer Army. The German units were unable to hold their grounds against the Allied forces, were pushed past Paris towards Mons in Belgium. There, the unit was trapped by Allied forces in a kesselschlacht in September 1944 and destroyed.\n\nIn 1944, the 47th Infantry Division was redeployed as the 47th Volksgrenadier Division.",

In time, the term has come to be identified as any deliberate distortion of scientific facts or theories for purposes that are deemed politically, religiously or socially desirable.\n\nMore than 3,000 mainstream biologists were dismissed or imprisoned, and numerous scientists were executed in the Soviet campaign to suppress scientific opponents. The president of the Soviet Agriculture Academy, Nikolai Vavilov, who had been Lysenko's mentor, but later denounced him, was sent to prison and died there, while Soviet genetics research was effectively destroyed. Research and teaching in the fields of neurophysiology, cell biology, and many other biological disciplines were harmed or banned.\n\nThe government of the Soviet Union (USSR) supported the campaign, and Joseph Stalin personally edited a speech by Lysenko in a way that reflected his support for what would come to be known as Lysenkoism, despite his skepticism toward Lysenko's assertion that all science is class-oriented in nature. Lysenko served as the director of the USSR's Lenin All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences. Other countries of the Eastern Bloc including the People's Republic of Poland, the Republic of Czechoslovakia, and the German Democratic Republic accepted Lysenkoism as the official \"new biology\", to varying degrees, as did the People's Republic of China for some years.\n\nContext\n\nMendelian genetics, the science of heredity, developed into an experimentally-based field of biology at the start of the 20th century through the work of August Weismann, Thomas Hunt Morgan, and others, building on the rediscovered work of Gregor Mendel. They showed that the characteristics of an organism were carried by inherited genes, which were located on chromosomes in each cell's nucleus. These could be affected by random changes, mutations, and could be shuffled and recombined during sexual reproduction, but were otherwise passed on unchanged from parent to offspring. Beneficial changes could spread through a population by natural selection or, in agriculture, by plant breeding. In contrast, Lamarckism proposes that an organism can somehow pass on characteristics that it has acquired during its lifetime to its offspring, implying that change in the body can affect the genetic material in the germ line.\n\nMarxism\u2013Leninism, which became an official ideological doctrine in Stalin's USSR, incorporated Darwinian evolutionary theory as its integral part. Initially, Lamarckian principle of inheritance of acquired traits was considered a legitimate part of the evolutionary theory, and even Darwin himself recognized its importance. Although the Lamarckian hypothesis was essentially abandoned in the West by 1925, it was still a part of the Soviet ideological doctrine. Besides the fervent \"old style\" Darwinism of Marx and Engels (which included elements of Lamarckian theory), two other factors prevented abandonment of the Lamarckian doctrine in the USSR. First, Ivan Pavlov, who discovered conditional reflex, initially announced that conditional reflex in mice can be inherited; his subsequent withdrawal of this claim in light of new evidences didn't lead to abandonment of Lamarckian doctrine by Soviet ideologists. Second, Ivan Michurin's work on plant breeding was interpreted by him as proof of inheritance of acquired traits, which bolstered anti-Mendelian theoretical views.\n\nSoviet agriculture around 1930 was in a crisis due to the forced collectivisation of farms, and the extermination of the kulak peasant farmers. The resulting Soviet famine of 1932\u20131933 provoked the government to search for a solution to the critical lack of food. Lysenko's attack on the \"bourgeois pseudoscience\" of modern genetics and the proposal that plants can rapidly adjust to a changed environment suited the ideological battle in both agriculture and Soviet society. State media published enthusiastic articles such as \"Siberia is transformed into a land of orchards and gardens,\" \"Soviet people change nature\" while anyone opposing Lysenko was presented as a defender of \"mysticism, obscurantism and backwardness.\"\n\nLysenko's claims\n\nIn 1928, rejecting natural selection and Mendelian genetics, Trofim Lysenko claimed to have developed agricultural techniques which could radically increase crop yields. These included vernalization, species transformation, inheritance of acquired characteristics, and vegetative hybridization. He claimed in particular that vernalization, exposing wheat seeds to humidity and low temperature, could greatly increase crop yield. He claimed further that he could transform one species, Triticum durum (pasta wheat, a spring wheat), into another, Triticum vulgare (bread wheat, an autumn wheat), by 2\u20134 years of autumn planting. Since T. durum is a tetraploid with 28 chromosomes (4 sets of 7), and T. vulgare is hexaploid with 42 chromosomes (6 sets), Western geneticists at that time already knew this was impossible.\n\nLysenko further claimed that Lamarckian inheritance of acquired characteristics occurred in plants, as in the \"eyes\" of potato tubers, though the genetic differences in these plant parts were already known to be somatic mutations. He also claimed that when a tree is grafted, the scion permanently changes the heritable characteristics of the stock. This would constitute vegetative hybridization, which Yongsheng Liu and colleagues note could possibly occur by horizontal gene transfer.\n\nRise\n\nIsaak Izrailevich Prezent brought Lysenko to public attention, using Soviet propaganda to portray him as a genius who had developed a new, revolutionary agricultural technique. Lysenko's resulting popularity gave him a platform to denounce theoretical genetics and to promote his own agricultural practices. He was, in turn, supported by the Soviet propaganda machine, which overstated his successes, cited faked experimental results, and omitted mention of his failures.\n\nLysenko's political success was mostly due to his appeal to the Communist Party and Soviet ideology. Following the disastrous collectivization efforts of the late 1920s, Lysenko's \"new\" methods were seen by Soviet officials as paving the way to an \"agricultural revolution.\" Lysenko himself was from a peasant family, and was an enthusiastic advocate of Leninism. The Party-controlled newspapers applauded Lysenko's \"practical\" efforts and questioned the motives of his critics. Lysenko's \"revolution in agriculture\" had a powerful propaganda advantage over the academics, who urged the patience and observation required for science. Lysenko was admitted into the hierarchy of the Communist Party, and was put in charge of agricultural affairs. He used his position to denounce biologists as \"fly-lovers and people haters,\" and to decry the \"wreckers\" in biology, who he claimed were trying to disable the Soviet economy and cause it to fail. Furthermore, he denied the distinction between theoretical and applied biology and concepts such as control groups and statistics in general:\n\n\"We biologists do not take the slightest interest in mathematical calculations, which confirm the useless statistical formulae of the Mendelists \u2026 We do not want to submit to blind chance \u2026 We maintain that biological regularities do not resemble mathematical laws.\"\n\nLysenko presented himself as a follower of Ivan Vladimirovich Michurin, a well-known and well-liked Soviet horticulturist, but unlike Michurin, he advocated a form of Lamarckism, insisting on using only hybridization and grafting, as non-genetic techniques.\n\nSupport from Joseph Stalin increased Lysenko's momentum and popularity. In 1935, Lysenko compared his opponents in biology to the peasants who still resisted the Soviet government's collectivization strategy, saying that by opposing his theories, the traditional geneticists were setting themselves against Marxism. Stalin was in the audience when this speech was made, and he was the first one to stand and applaud, calling out \"Bravo, Comrade Lysenko. Bravo.\" This emboldened Lysenko, and gave him and Prezent free rein to slander any geneticists who still spoke out against him. After the appointment of Lysenko as head of the V.I. Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences, classical genetics began to be publicly called \"fascist science\" and many of Lysenkoism's opponents, such as his former mentor Nikolai Ivanovich Vavilov, were imprisoned or executed because of their denunciations, although Lysenko wasn't directly responsible for this incident.\n\nOn August 7, 1948, at the end of a week-long session organized by Lysenko and approved by Stalin, the V.I. Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences announced that from that point on Lysenkoism would be taught as \"the only correct theory.\" Soviet scientists were forced to denounce any work that contradicted Lysenko. Criticism of Lysenko was denounced as \"bourgeois\" or \"fascist,\" and analogous \"non-bourgeois\" theories also flourished in other fields such as linguistics and art in the Soviet academy at this time. Perhaps the only opponents of Lysenkoism during Stalin's lifetime to escape liquidation were from the small community of Soviet nuclear physicists: as Tony Judt has observed, \"It is significant that Stalin left his nuclear physicists alone and never presumed to second guess their calculations. Stalin may well have been mad but he was not stupid.\"\n\nEffects\n\nFrom 1934 to 1940, under Lysenko's admonitions and with Stalin's approval, many geneticists were executed (including Izrail Agol, Solomon Levit, Grigorii Levitskii, Georgii Karpechenko and Georgii Nadson) or",

  "Time in China\n\nThe time in China follows a single standard time offset of UTC+08:00 (eight hours ahead of Coordinated Universal Time), even though China spans almost five geographical time zones. The official national standard time is called Beijing Time (BJT, ) domestically and China Standard Time (CST) internationally. Daylight saving time has not been observed since 1991.\n\nChina Standard Time (UTC+8) is consistent across Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Philippines, Singapore, Brunei, Mongolia, etc.\n\nHistory\n\nIn the 1870s, the Shanghai Xujiahui Observatory was constructed by a French Catholic missionary. In 1880s officials in Shanghai French Concession started to provide a time announcement service using the Shanghai Mean Solar Time provided by the aforementioned observatory for ships into and out of Shanghai. By the end of 19th century, the time standard provided by the observatory had been switched to GMT+08:00. The practice has spread to other coastal ports, and in 1902 the \"Coastal Time\" was proposed to be the universal time zone for all the coastal ports in China. However, the time zone for the rest of China remained undetermined.\n\nUntil 1913, the official time standard for the whole of China was still the apparent solar time of Beijing, the capital of the country at the time. Starting in 1914, the Republic of China government began adopting the Beijing Local Mean Solar Time as the official time standard. By 1918, five standard time zones had been proposed by the Central Observatory of Beiyang government of Republic of China, including the Kunlun (UTC+05:30), Sinkiang-Tibet (UTC+06:00), Kansu-Szechwan (UTC+07:00), Chungyuan (UTC+08:00), and Changpai (UTC+08:30).\n\nAfter the defeat of Beiyang government in 1928, the mission of the Central Observatory was moved to Nanjing, and the reference time standard used for the construction of traditional Chinese Calendar was shifted from Beijing Mean Solar Time to UTC+08:00.\n\nIn the 1930s, the proposed five time zones had not been fully observed, causing regions in inner China area to adopt their own time standards, resulting in chaos. On 9 March 1939, when the Ministry of the Interior organized a Standard Time Conference in Chongqing, it was decided to adopt the five time zone proposal with slight modification of their borders starting from 1 June, however it was also decided that the entire country would use the Kansu-Szechwan Time (UTC+07:00) during the Second Sino-Japanese War which began at the time.\n\nFollowing the end of World War II, the five time zone system was resumed, although there is little information about the historical usage of time in the Kunlun and Changpai zones. A further refined system with adjustment to zone assignment in the Northwest part of Gansu was announced in 1947 for adoption in 1948. However, as the Chinese Civil War came to its end in 1949\u20131950, regional governments under the influence of the Communist Party of China, other than those in Xinjiang and Tibet, switched to use the same time as Beijing, which is UTC+08:00, and is later known as Beijing Time or China Standard Time.\n\nThere are two independent sources that claim the Communist Party of China, and/or the People's Republic of China, were using apparent solar time for Beijing Time before the period between 27 September 1949 and 6 October 1949, and they adopted the time of UTC+08:00 within that period of time, but the claim is dubious.\n\nTime zone changes in Tibet are undocumented, but Beijing Time was in use until at least the mid-1950s. Between 1969 and 1986, the time zone was switched repeatedly between Xinjiang Time (UTC+06:00) and Beijing Time.\n\nDaylight saving time was observed from 1945 to 1948, and from 1986 to 1991.\n\nIn 1997 and 1999, Hong Kong and Macau were transferred to China from the United Kingdom and Portugal respectively, being established as special administrative regions. Although the sovereignty of the SARs belongs to China, they retain their own policies regarding time zones for historical reasons. Due to their geographical locations, both are within the UTC+08:00 time zone, which is the same as the national standard, Beijing time.\n\nGeography\n\nAs an illustration of the wide range, the daylight hours (Beijing Time) for the seats of the westernmost (both including and not including Xinjiang due to local customs, see below) and easternmost counties, calculated for the year 2010, are shown here:\n\nThe border with Afghanistan at the Wakhjir Pass has the most significant official change of clocks for any international land frontier: UTC+08:00 in China to UTC+04:30 in Afghanistan.\n\nXinjiang\n\nIn Xinjiang, two time standards are used in parallel, namely Beijing Time and Xinjiang Time.\n\nXinjiang Time, also known as \u00dcr\u00fcmqi Time, is set due to its geographical location in the westernmost part of the country. The time offset is UTC+06:00, which is two hours behind Beijing, and is shared with neighbouring Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.\n\nSome local Xinjiang authorities now use both time standards side by side. Television stations schedule programmes in different time standards according to their nature.\n\nThe coexistence of two time zones within the same region causes some confusion among the local population, especially when inter-racial communication occurs. When a time is mentioned in conversation between Han and Uyghur, it is necessary to either explicitly make clear whether the time is in Xinjiang Time or Beijing Time, or convert the time according to the ethnicity of the other party. The double time standard is particularly observable in Xinjiang Television, which schedules its Chinese channel according to Beijing time and its Uyghur and Kazakh channels according to Xinjiang time.\n\nRegardless, Beijing Time users in Xinjiang usually schedule their daily activities two hours later than those who live in eastern China. As such, stores and offices in Xinjiang are commonly open from 10am to 7pm Beijing Time, which equals 8am to 5pm in \u00dcr\u00fcmqi Time. This is known as the work/rest time in Xinjiang.\n\nIn most areas of Xinjiang, the opening time of local authorities is additionally modified by shifting the morning session 30\u201360 minutes earlier and the afternoon session 30 minutes later to extend the lunch break for 60\u201390 minutes, so as to avoid the intense heat during noon time in the area during summer.\n\nHong Kong and Macau\n\nHong Kong and Macau maintain their own time authorities after transfer of sovereignty in 1997 and 1999 respectively. The Hong Kong Time and Macau Standard Time (Hora Oficial de Macau ) are both UTC+08:00 all year round, thus in line with Beijing time, and daylight saving time has not been used since 1979 in Hong Kong and 1980 in Macau. In Hong Kong, Greenwich Mean Time was adopted as the basis in 1904, and UTC was adopted as a standard in 1972. Before that, local time was determined by astronomical observations at Hong Kong Observatory using a.\n\nIANA time zone database\n\nThe territory of the People's Republic of China is covered in the IANA time zone database by the following zones. \"Asia/Shanghai\" is used instead of \"Asia/Beijing\" because Shanghai is the most populous location in the zone.\n\nColumns marked with * are from the file zone.tab of the database.\n\nBackward compatibility zone\n\nThe following zones, including Asia/Kashgar, Asia/Chongqing, and Asia/Harbin, are kept in the \"backzone\" file of the IANA time zone database for backward compatibility.",

  "24 cm Kanone 3\n\nThe 24-cm-Kanone 3 (24 cm K 3) was a German heavy siege gun used in the Second World War by the first battalion of Artillerie-Regiment 84. Four were in service when Germany invaded Poland, assigned to the first two batteries of I./AR 84, and in the Battle of France. By Operation Barbarossa all three batteries were equipped with two guns apiece. This situation did not change for the next two years.\n\nDesign and history\n\nThe gun for the K 3 was of standard construction while the carriage was considerably more innovative. Rheinmetall placed a lot of emphasis on ease of assembly. It did not require a crane because it used electric winches, mounted on the carriage, to pull various parts through a system of inclined ramps, guide rails and runways. It also used the Rheinmetall's dual-recoil system, first seen on the 21 cm M\u00f6rser 18. The barrel recoiled normally in its cradle, but, in addition, the whole top carriage, which carried the barrel and its cradle, recoiled across the main part of the carriage. This system damped out the recoil forces and made for a very steady firing platform.\n\nThe K 3 was transported in six loads consisting of the firing platform, carriage, cradle, barrel, breech and an electric generator.\n\nThe Wehrmacht was not content with the gun's performance: \"It was felt to be wasteful of time and manpower, the transport arrangements were cumbersome and the performance was not considered to be commensurate with the size of weapon.\" These led to experiments by Krupp and Rheinmetall to extend the range. These included \"pre-grooved\" projectiles which showed no significant improvement, squeeze-bore, discarding sabot and even a smoothbore version. None of these reached beyond the experimental stage.",

Becoming interested in geology at an early age, he was one of the founders of the Geological Society of France in 1830. In 1834 he was appointed librarian of the Mus\u00e9um National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris. He was elected a Foreign Member of the Geological Society of London in 1864.

  "MY Ady Gil\n\nMY Ady Gil (formerly Earthrace) was a 78 ft, wave-piercing trimaran originally created as part of a project to break the world record for circumnavigating the globe in a powerboat. Powered by biodiesel fuel, the vessel was also capable of running on regular diesel fuel. It used other eco-friendly materials such as vegetable oil lubricants, hemp composites, and non-toxic anti-fouling, and had features such as bilge-water filters.\n\nThe first attempt at the global circumnavigation record in 2007 was ill-fated. The boat encountered mechanical problems on several occasions and collided with a Guatemalan fishing boat, killing one of the other boat's crew. While the crew of the Earthrace was later absolved of any responsibility, the delay forced the restart of the record attempt, while more mechanical issues later aborted it. In 2008, the second journey proved successful\u2014though again, numerous technical problems had to be overcome before the record was achieved, with the vessel finally making the return to Sagunto, Spain after just under 61 days on 27 June 2008.\n\nIn late 2009, it was announced that the boat, now repainted black and named Ady Gil, would be participating in anti-whaling operations under the lead of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. During operations in the Southern Ocean, the vessel and the Japanese whaling support vessel collided on 6 January 2010, resulting in loss of the Ady Gil's bow and injuring one crew member. Each side blamed the other for causing the collision, and government agencies began an investigation into the incident. The crew of the Ady Gil were removed from the damaged vessel and the salvage operation was abandoned, with the vessel sinking the next day.\n\nDesign\n\nThe vessel was designed by LOMOcean Design (formerly Craig Loomes Design Group Ltd.) and built by Calibre Boats in Auckland, New Zealand. The wave-piercing trimaran design allowed for improved speed and stability. The boat was fully submersible, able to cut through 15 m waves and go 7 m underwater. The hull was composed of a composite carbon fibre and kevlar with a non-toxic anti-fouling paint.\n\nThe vessel was powered by two 540 horsepower Cummins Mercruiser engines that ran on an animal fat and vegetable oil mix biodiesel. It could be run on diesel, biodiesel or blends. To cool and provide fresh air to the engines, intakes were located on two dramatic fins. The Ady Gil's twin propellers were mounted under the main hull, while the rudders were mounted in the pontoons. This design provided good turning at speed, but limited maneuverability at speeds below 12 knots. Despite its design as an \"eco-boat\", David MacKay calculates that it has significantly greater energy consumption per passenger-kilometre than a jet-ski or the QE2.\n\nThe $2.5 million cost was mostly funded by sponsors, and the only luxury item aboard was the $10,000 toilet. When asked, \"Regrets about the cost of it all?\" skipper Pete Bethune replied, \"No &hellip; You know, I do have the coolest boat in the world.\"\n\nRecord attempts\n\nEarthrace was intended to showcase environmentally friendly technologies. It broke the world record for circumnavigating the globe in a motorized boat. It set the record in 60 days 23 hours and 49 minutes. This beat the record of 74 days, 20 hours, 58 minutes set by the Cable and Wireless Adventurer (then the Ocean 7 Adventurer), in 1998, by 13 days 21 hours and 9 minutes. It is unclear if the circumnavigation was faster than the disputed time set by the US Navy's USS Triton nuclear-powered submarine during Operation Sandblast. The time established by Earthrace did not supersede the overall record set by the 103-ft sailing trimaran Groupama 3 skipped by Franck Cammas with 48d 7h 44' 52\" or the latest 2012 record set by Banque Populaire V, a 131-ft trimaran skipped by Lo\u00efck Peyron, with 45d 13h 42' 53\".\n\n2007\n\nThe attempt originally departed from Barbados on 10 March 2007 but encountered significant delays including problems with the propellers and other mechanical issues.\n\nA problem with an engine off Palau caused an 8-day delay because of the remoteness. On the night of 19 March 2007, while around 22 km offshore from Guatemala, Earthrace collided with a local fishing boat. No Earthrace crew were hurt, but one of the three crew members from the fishing boat was never found. The crew was absolved of any responsibility after a 10-day investigation during which they were held in custody. The delays prevented Earthrace from completing the circumnavigation in record time, but because Earthrace took an official start time when leaving San Diego, the team decided to \"restart\" with this new start/finish line. They departed San Diego on 7 April 2007 and needed to return by 21 June to break the record. However, the attempt was abandoned on 31 May 2007 after a crack was discovered in the hull shortly after leaving M\u00e1laga, Spain.\n\nThe biofuel came from a wide range of suppliers and was derived from various cash crops. Bethune reluctantly had to fall back on conventional diesel once due to a lack of availability.\n\n2008\n\nAfter a refit at the Vulkan Shipyard at the Port of Sagunto, a second attempt on the record began at 14:35 (CET) on 27 April 2008. On board were Rob Drewett (cameraman), Adam Carlson (navigator), Mark Russel (engineer) and Bethune (skipper/owner). The route for the second world record attempt and estimated time for each leg was as follows:\n\nThe boat experienced problems with the autopilot two days after departure, and then on 30 April the lift pump of the starboard engine became blocked. However, although some time was lost, the boat arrived at the Azores slightly ahead of schedule for the world record attempt and with all technical problems apparently solved.\n\nThe next two legs went without any major problems and the crew managed to bypass a big backlog of ships in the Panama Canal. On day 22 about half way to Hawaii, a severe vibration caused them to stop and after Bethune went under the boat in the dark with a torch to investigate, he discovered that some nylon netting was entangled in one prop and had to be removed.\n\nShortly after leaving Palau on day 34, Earthrace struck submerged debris which sheared two blades off the port propeller and bent the drive shaft. This necessitated a return to Palau in order to assess the damage and remove the prop. The boat then continued to Singapore on one engine, while plans were set in motion to manufacture a new drive shaft and obtain another propeller. Once in Singapore, Earthrace was hoisted from the water in a sling and repairs were effected on the dockside in record time.\n\nOn day 48 the crew were suffering from heat and high humidity and were all affected by heat rash. At this time they had also encountered monsoon weather and their speed was much reduced due to mountainous waves. The heavy seas continued all the way to Oman and beyond before entering the Red Sea. During this stretch the boat's transponder was damaged and the marine tracker stopped working. On day 56, en route to Port Suez, the lift pump malfunctioned, limiting their speed to 16 knots. This required three hours worth of maintenance to change it.\n\nOn Friday, 27 June 2008, Earthrace set a new world record for powered circumnavigation of the globe, when it crossed the finish line at 14:24 CET at Sagunto, Spain.\n\nParticipation in 'Waltzing Matilda'\n\nIt was announced that the Earthrace would accompany Sea Shepherd in its 2009\u201310 operations (named 'Waltzing Matilda') against Japanese whaling in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary. Bethune said that an agreement was reached with Sea Shepherd for the boat to adopt a support role. Sea Shepherd noted that the vessel had been the only one in the fleet fast enough to keep up with all vessels of the Japanese whaling fleet.\n\nOn 17 October 2009, the Earthrace was presented to the media with a new black paint job, and it was renamed Ady Gil, after the name of a major sponsor (a Hollywood lighting-equipment magnate who had donated $1 million to the group). The new paint job and futuristic appearance of the boat itself often evoked comparisons to Batman vehicles and stealth craft in the media.\n\n4\u20138 layers of Kevlar were added to protect the hull against ice with the thickness depending on the location, with all areas under the waterline getting the extra laminations of kevlar as well as some areas above the waterline. To reduce its radar profile for the Japanese fleet, the ship was painted with a paint intended to scatter radar signals and a broadband radar which has near-zero radar emissions. Despite being referred to as a stealth craft, the Ady Gil lacks the angles and curvature of form designed to deflect radar away from the emitter rather than back to them. Other electronics upgrades included FLIR cameras, Iridium satellite communications as well as an array of speakers which were intended for communication purposes. Bethune said that he intended to play songs like Tangaroa from New Zealand musician Tiki Taane to the whalers, a \"growling big sort of a song about the God of the Sea who looks after us\".\n\nSea Shepherd crew said before the journey that Ady Gil would not be used as a confrontational vessel like the Steve Irwin",

  "Erik Proper\n\nHenderik Alex (Erik) Proper (born 22 May 1967) is a Dutch computer scientist, an FNR PEARL Laureate, and a senior research manager within the Computer Science (ITIS) department of the Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology (LIST). He is also Adjunct Professor in Data & Knowledge Engineering at the University of Luxembourg. He is known for work on conceptual modeling, enterprise architecture and enterprise engineering.\n\nBiography\n\nBorn in Rheden, Proper studied Computer Science at the Radboud University Nijmegen. In 1990 he received his MSc, and in 1994 his PhD with distinction with a thesis entitled \"A Theory for Conceptual Modelling of Evolving Application Domains\" under supervision of Eckhard D. Falkenberg.\n\nAfter graduation, Proper started his academic as Computer Science researcher at the University of Queensland in Australia, and lecturer at the Queensland University of Technology. Back in The Netherlands in 1997 Proper started working in the software industry as consultant at Atos Origin in Amsterdam, and later for Ordina in Gouda. He was appointed as an Adjunct Professor at the Radboud University in Nijmegen, where he became Full Professor of Evolving Information Systems in 2002. From 2008 to 2010 he worked as a consultant for Capgemini. In 2010 he became a senior researcher at the Public Research Centre Henri Tudor, which was later merged with Public Research Centre Gabriel Lippmann to become the Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology. Between 2008 and 2018, he also continued his affiliation with Radboud University as an Adjunct Professor. Since June 2017, he also holds an Adjunct Professorship in Data & Knowledge Engineering at the University of Luxembourg.\n\nIn 2012 Proper was awarded the IFIP Outstanding Service Award from the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP).\n\nAs of January 2022, Erik is vice-chair of the IFIP 8.1 working group, while also being the representative for the Netherlands in IFIP's TC8 technical committee. He is also the Stellvertretender Sprecher (vice chair) of the EMISA working group of the German Computer Science Society (Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Informatik).\n\nA Theory for Conceptual Modelling of Evolving Application Domains, 1994\n\nIn his 1994 PhD thesis \"A Theory for Conceptual Modelling of Evolving Application Domains,\" Proper developed a formal specification of information system development. This specification was based Object-role modeling, and was one of the many extensions to its basic framework. These extensions are basically abstract mechanisms, that \"allow users to control the amount of detail seen at any given time.\"\n\nWhile Proper focussed on schema evolution with Object-role modeling, other researchers in the 1990s had focussed on a range of related topics. Halpin (2006) summarized that that research ranged from \"reverse engineering, support for complex objects, process-event modeling, external schema generation... schema optimization, meta-modeling, subtype extensions, null handling, object-oriented mapping, unary nesting, [to] empirical research.\"\n\nEnterprise Architecture, 2009\n\nIn the 2009 \"Enterprise Architecture: Creating Value by Informed Governance,\" Op 't Land and Proper traced the notion of architecture in the field of information systems development. They summarized:\n\n\"When software applications became larger and larger, people such as Shaw and Garlan coined the term software architecture. This notion of architecture deals with the key design principles underlying software artefacts. In the 1980s and 1990s, people became aware that the development of information technology (IT) should be done in conjunction with the development of the context in which it was used. This led to the identification of the so-called business/IT alignment problem. Solving the business/IT alignment problem requires enterprises to align human, organizational, informational, and technological aspects of systems...'\"\n\nAnd furthermore: \"Quite early on, the term architecture was also introduced as a means to further alignment, and thus analyzes and solves business?IT alignment problems, Recently, the awareness emerged that alignment between business and IT is not enough, there are many more aspects in the enterprise in need of alignment. This has led to the use of the term architecture at the enterprise level: enterprise architecture.\"\n\nArchitecture Principles, 2011\n\nIn \"Architecture Principles \u2013 The Cornerstones of Enterprise Architecture,\" (2011) Greefhorst and Proper present an extensive study of architecture principles. They presume that \"enterprises, from small to large, evolve continuously. As a result, their structures are transformed and extended continuously. Without some means of control, such changes are bound to lead to an overly complex, uncoordinated and heterogeneous environment that is hard to manage and hard to adapt to future changes. Enterprise architecture principles provide a means to direct transformations of enterprises. As a consequence, architecture principles should be seen as the cornerstones of any architecture.\"\n\nFurthermore they argue, that this work \"provide[s] both a theoretical and a practical perspective on architecture principles. The theoretical perspective involves a brief survey of the general concept of principle as well as an analysis of different flavors of principles. Architecture principles are regarded as a specific class of normative principles that direct the design of an enterprise, from the definition of its business to its supporting IT. The practical perspective on architecture principles is concerned with an approach to the formulation of architecture principles, as well as their actual use in organizations.\"\n\nPublications\n\nProper has authored and co-authored numerous publications in the fields of enterprise engineering, enterprise architecture and enterprise modelling.

  "A Biography of Maria Gaetana Agnesi\n\nA Biography of Maria Gaetana Agnesi, an Eighteenth-Century Woman Mathematician: With Translations of Some of Her Work from Italian into English is a biography of Italian mathematician and philosopher Maria Gaetana Agnesi (1718\u20131799). It was written and translated by Antonella Cupillari, with a foreword by Patricia R. Allaire, and published in 2008 by the Edwin Mellen Press.\n\nTopics\n\nThe main part of the book, over 100 pages, is a translation into English of an Italian-language biography of Agnesi, Elogio storico di Donna Maria Gaetana Agnesi, which was written in the year of her death by historian Antonio Francesco Frisi and republished in 1965. It covers the cultural background that allowed her to become a mathematician, and her brief mathematical career from her teens to her thirties, as well as her work caring for the needy in the remaining fifty years of her life.\n\nFrisi was a family friend of Agnesi, and his was the first biography of her. To balance this material with a more objective view of Agnesi, Cupillari has added over 50 pages of notes, derived from two more Italian-language biographies of Agnesi, Maria Gaetana \u00c0gnesi (Luisa Anzoletti, 1900) and Maria Gaetana Agnesi (Giovanna Tilche, 1984). Another large section includes translations and explanations of excerpts from Agnesi's mathematical textbook, Institutioni Analitiche (1748), which was \"the first textbook to provide a unified treatment of algebra, Cartesian geometry and calculus\", and by being written in vernacular Italian rather than Latin was aimed at a wider audience than the educated scholars of her day. Cupillari concludes her biography with a bibliography of material about Agnesi.\n\nAudience and reception\n\nReviewers Luigi Pepe and Franka Bruckler recommend the book as a \"useful introduction\" and \"unique, comprehensive source\" on Agnesi and her work, particularly for people who read English but not Italian. Bruckler includes among its potential readers historians of mathematics, mathematics educators, and members of the public. Reviewer Edith Mendez describes the book as \"an easy read\", and its mathematics as accessible to undergraduate mathematics students, but this is contradicted by Peter Ruane, who found the \"fragmented\" and \"eulogistic\" first part difficult to follow and to stomach. Mendez also criticizes the book for being inadequately copyedited, and Ruane suggests that the book would have been improved by more context of what was happening in mathematics in Europe at the time.",
  "While the World Was Burning\n\nWhile the World Was Burning is the third studio album by American rapper Saint Jhn. It was released on November 20, 2020 by G\u00f8dd Complexx under Hitco, and marketed digitally via ADA division of Warner Music Group. It features guest appearances from Kanye West, Lil Uzi Vert, Future, A Boogie wit da Hoodie, DaBaby, JID, 6Lack and Kehlani.\n\nBackground\n\nOriginally Saint Jhn had no plans to release another album in 2020, but throughout the year he managed to connect with fellow artists Kanye West, Lil Uzi Vert, Future, JID, A Boogie wit da Hoodie and Kehlani. His single \"Roses\" also gained massive attention over the summer and became his first solo No. 1 on the Billboard charts. Because of this, he felt \"it would be irresponsible to not put out another collection\". The title While the World Was Burning was inspired by the events that unfolded in 2020 such as the COVID-19 pandemic, George Floyd riots, the 2020 US election etc. Saint Jhn calls the album a capsule collection.\n\nIn late September, Saint Jhn visited Kanye West in Wyoming. In several interviews after the release of the collection, Saint Jhn said that West had gotten a hold of his number after having heard his song \"Roses\" 20 times in a row on a jet plane. West wanted him to come to Wyoming and record with him there and threw out the idea that he could executive produce While the World Was Burning with Rick Rubin. Saint Jhn and West later flew down to Jamaica to record with Buju Banton.\n\nThe songs \"High School Reunion\" and \"Monica Lewinsky, Election Year\" are reworked versions of songs from his 2019 album Ghetto Lenny's Love Songs.\n\nRelease and promotion\n\nAfter getting massive success with the remix of his single \"Roses\" over the summer of 2020, Saint Jhn teased on August 25 on a (now deleted) Instagram post that he would release a collection of songs in October. In mid September, Saint Jhn announced that his album While The World Was Burning would release on October 16. On October 9, Saint Jhn would release the lead single \"Gorgeous\". The day after, he went to Twitter to announce that he had delayed the album to November 20. On October 26, Saint Jhn released the single \"Sucks to Be You\", and two days later the cover art, release date and track listing for the album.\n\nOn November 21, a day after the release, Saint Jhn said on Twitter that the album would be updated with some tweaks and changes and a song with Kanye West that did not make the cut. The missing track titled \"Smack DVD\" featuring Kanye West was released a week later, however it did not get added onto the track listing of the album. Saint Jhn posted a track listing of a different version of the album to his Twitter with \"Smack DVD\" after \"Pray 4 Me\", among other track listing differences. The album was updated on streaming services to have the new track order with \"Smack DVD\" in the track listing a week later.\n\nTrack listing\n\nTrack listing and credits adapted from Tidal.",

  "East Branch Fishing Creek\n\nEast Branch Fishing Creek is a tributary of Fishing Creek in Columbia County and Sullivan County, Pennsylvania, in the United States. It is 4.4 mi long. The stream and its tributaries are acidic and contain aluminum. The area in the vicinity was first settled in the late 18th century.\n\nCourse\n\nEast Branch Fishing Creek primarily flows in a largely westward direction, from its source at State Game Lands #13, slightly west of Ricketts Glen State Park, to its mouth slightly north of Grassmere Park. The creek starts at the confluence of Sullivan Branch and Big Run. It starts flowing southwards for approximately one mile before picking up Heberly Run, its longest tributary. Further on, it receives Lead Run and turns southwest towards Jamison City. Shortly after the turn, the creek receives Trout Run, one of its shortest named tributaries. In Jamison City, the creek receives Blackberry Run and several unnamed tributaries before flowing into West Branch Fishing Creek. The total elevation change between East Branch Fishing Creek's source and its mouth is 1500 ft.\n\nHydrology\n\nAt one location, East Branch Fishing Creek's discharge is 19.7 cubic feet per second. The average discharges of the streams in the creek's watershed range from 63 gallons per minute at the headwaters of Heberly Run to 15,498 gallons per minute at East Branch Fishing Creek's mouth.\n\nThe creek's watershed is acidic. One contributing factor to this may be the presence of acidic bogs. It is a freestone stream.\n\nThe average pHs of the streams in the East Branch Fishing Creek watershed range from 4.32 to 5.76. The lowest pH occurs on Meeker Run and the highest pH occurs on Shanty Run. At two sites on East Branch Fishing Creek itself, the creek's pH is 5.34 (at its confluence with Lead Run) and 5.63 (at its mouth). The average amount of aluminum in the streams in the watershed ranges from 0.024 milligrams per liter to 0.366 milligrams per liter. The highest concentration occurs on Ore Run and the lowest concentration occurs on the mouth of East Branch Fishing Creek. One stream in the watershed, Big Run, has a pH range of less than 3 to slightly under 7. The main stem has a pH range of slightly over 4 to slightly over 6.\n\nDuring a study of the waters of East Branch Fishing Creek and its tributaries, no stream miles in the watershed have been rated as very good. 27% (9.23 stream miles) have been rated as good, 30% (10.21 stream miles) have been rated as fair, 14% (4.8 stream miles) have been rated as poor, 3% (1.07 stream miles) have been rated as very poor, and 26% (8.85 stream miles) have been rated as severe. The lowest-quality water tends to be on Meeker Run, Blackberry Run, Sullivan Branch, Ore Run, and Lead Run. Big Run, Quinn Run, and the East Branch Fishing Creek mouth have the highest-quality waters.\n\nEast Branch Fishing Creek receives an average of 39.16 tons of calcium carbonate per year.\n\nThe number of pounds of acidity that flow through various streams in the watershed of East Branch Fishing Creek per day ranges from 197.74 lb at the headwaters of Sullivan Branch to 1788.14 lb downstream of the confluence of East Branch Fishing Creek with Trout Run. The number of pounds of acid per day flowing through East Branch Fishing Creek itself ranges from 1569.07 lb downstream of East Branch Fishing Creek's confluence with Lead Run to 1788.14 lb downstream of East Branch Fishing Creek's confluence with Trout Run.\n\nThe number of pounds of aluminum that flow through various streams in the watershed of East Branch Fishing Creek per day ranges from 11.73 lb at the headwaters of Heberly Run to 316.35 lb downstream of East Branch Fishing Creek's confluence with Lead Run. The number of pounds of aluminum per day flowing through East Branch Fishing Creek itself ranges from 83.40 lb at the creek's mouth to 316.35 lb on East Branch Fishing Creek downstream of its confluence with Lead Run.\n\nThe average water temperature on East Branch Fishing Creek in 2009 ranged from 9.1 C to 11.3 C at various sites along the creek and its tributaries.\n\nGeology\n\nThe rock underneath the East Branch Fishing Creek watershed consists of sandstone and interbedded sedimentary rock. However, there is little limestone bedrock in the watershed, unlike many watersheds in Pennsylvania. Most of the watershed is in the High Plateau Section of the Appalachian Plateau Province, but a small part of it is in the Ridge and Valley Province.\n\nThere are a number of rock formations in the East Branch Fishing Creek watershed. These are the Burgoon Sandstone, the Huntley Mountain Formation, the Catskill Formation, and the Mauch Chunk Formation. The Burgoon Sandstone primarily occurs in the northern, eastern, and western parts of the watershed. The Huntley Mountain Formation occurs in the southeastern part of the watershed, as well as on most of the main tributaries of the creek. The Catskill Formation largely occurs along the main stem. The Mauch Chunk Formation occurs in a small area in the northern part of the watershed.\n\nThere are ten main soil associations in the East Branch Fishing Creek watershed. These include the Dystrochrepts/Deep-Wellsboro-Oquaga, the Oquaga, the Lackawanna, the Lackawana-Oquaga, the Wellsboro, the Barbour, the Morris, the Norwich, the Udifluvents, and the Basher. There are also rock outcroppings and several minor soil associations. The soils in the watershed are all strongly acidic, except on East Branch Fishing Creek itself.\n\nThe Dystrochrepts/Deep-Wellsboro-Oquaga soil association occurs in close proximity to East Branch Fishing Creek and its tributaries themselves. The Oquaga soil association occurs in the Blackberry Run, Trout Run, Lead Run, Heberly Run, and Piegon Run sub-watersheds. It also occurs in the northwestern corner of the watershed. The Lackawanna soil association occurs in the southern part of the watershed, starting just below Blackberry Run's confluence with East Branch Fishing Creek. The Wellsboro soil association occurs near the headwaters of Blackberry Run, Lead Run, Big Run, and Heberly Run. The Barbour soil association occurs on East Branch Fishing Creek near its mouth. The Morris soil association occurs in scattered areas in the northern part of the watershed. The Norwich soil association occurs in some areas at the headwaters of Heberly Run, Lead Run, Piegon Run, and Blackberry Run. The Udifluvents soil association occurs near the confluence of Heberly Run and East Branch Fishing Creek. The Basher soil association occurs in the southeastern portion of the watershed.\n\nWatershed\n\nThe watershed of East Branch Fishing Creek is entirely within the boundaries of Sullivan and Columbia Counties. There are a total of 34.16 stream miles in the watershed. As of 2010, there are 100 people in the watershed. 93.03% of the watershed consists of forest, 6.86% of the watershed is grassland, 0.06% of the land is agricultural, and 0.03% is water or wetlands. None of the watershed is barren. The entire watershed has an area of 19.5 square miles.\n\nHistory\n\nOne of the first settlers in the vicinity of East Branch Fishing Creek was Thomas Fritz, who arrived there in 1795 from Philadelphia.

  "Signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease\n\nSigns and symptoms of Parkinson's disease are varied. Parkinson's disease affects movement, producing motor symptoms. Non-motor symptoms, which include dysautonomia, cognitive and neurobehavioral problems, and sensory and sleep difficulties, are also common. When other diseases mimic Parkinson's disease, they are categorized as parkinsonism.\n\nMotor signs and symptoms\n\nFour motor symptoms are considered cardinal signs in PD: slowness of movement (bradykinesia), tremor, rigidity, and postural instability. Typical for PD is an initial asymmetric distribution of these symptoms, where in the course of the disease, a gradual progression to bilateral symptoms develops, although some asymmetry usually persists. Other motor symptoms include gait and posture disturbances such as decreased arm swing, a forward-flexed posture, and the use of small steps when walking; speech and swallowing disturbances; and other symptoms such as a mask-like facial expression or small handwriting are examples of the range of common motor problems that can appear.\n\nCardinal signs\n\nFour motor signs are considered cardinal in PD: tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability (also referred to as parkinsonism).\n\n\"... immobile patients who become excited may be able to make quick movements such as catching a ball (or may be able to suddenly run if someone screams 'fire'). This phenomenon (kinesia paradoxica) suggests that patients with PD have intact motor programmes, but have difficulties accessing them without an external trigger, such as a loud noise, marching music, or a visual cue requiring them to step over an obstacle.\"\n\nNeuropsychiatric\n\nParkinson's disease causes neuropsychiatric disturbances, which mainly include cognitive disorders, mood disorders, and behavior problems, and can be as disabling as motor symptoms.\n\nSince L-Dopa, the widely used drug in Parkinson's disease treatment, is decarboxylated by aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), which is found in both dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons, it is possible for serotonergic neurons to convert L-Dopa into dopamine and generate excessive neuronal death by creating reactive oxygen species and quinoproteins. The association of serotonin with mood and cognition may explain some of the side-effects observed in patients treated with L-Dopa due to serotonin deficit.\n\nIn most cases, motor symptoms predominate at early PD stages, while cognitive disturbances (such as mild cognitive impairment or dementia) emerge later. The onset of parkinsonism in PD relative to dementia is used as an arbitrary criterion to clinically distinguish Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) using a 'one-year rule'. Dementia onset within 12-months of or at the same time as motor dysfunctions qualified as DLB, whereas in PDD, parkinsonism had to precede dementia by at least one year.\n\nCognitive disturbances occur even in the initial stages of the disease in some cases. A very high proportion of patients have mild cognitive impairment as the disease advances. Most common deficits in nondemented patients are:\n\nDeficits tend to aggravate with time, developing in many cases into dementia. A person with PD has a six-fold increased risk of developing it, and the overall rate in people with the disease is around 30%. Moreover, prevalence of dementia increases in relation to disease duration, going up to 80%. Dementia has been associated with a reduced quality of life in patients and caregivers, increased mortality, and a higher probability of moving to a nursing home.\n\nCognitive problems and dementia are usually accompanied by behavior and mood alterations, although these kinds of changes are also more common in those patients without cognitive impairment than in the general population. Most frequent mood difficulties include:\n\nObsessive\u2013compulsive behaviors (also known as Impulse-control disorders) such as craving, binge eating, hypersexuality, pathological gambling, punding, or others, can also appear in PD, and have been related to a dopamine dysregulation syndrome associated with the medications for the disease.\n\nPsychotic symptoms are common in PD, generally associated with dopamine therapy. Symptoms of psychosis, or impaired reality testing, are either hallucinations, typically visual, less commonly auditory, and rarely in other domains including tactile, gustatory, or olfactory, or delusions, that is, irrational beliefs. Hallucinations are generally stereotyped and without emotional content. Initially, patients usually have insight so that the hallucinations are benign in terms of their immediate impact, but have poor prognostic implications, with increased risk of dementia, worsened psychotic symptoms, and mortality. Delusions occur in about 5-10% of treated patients, and are considerably more disruptive, being paranoid in nature, of spousal infidelity or family abandonment. Psychosis is an independent risk factor for nursing-home placement.\n\nHallucinations can occur in parkinsonian syndromes for a variety of reasons. An overlap exists between PD and dementia with Lewy bodies, so that where Lewy bodies are present in the visual cortex, hallucinations may result. Hallucinations can also be brought about by excessive dopaminergic stimulation. Most hallucinations are visual in nature, often formed as familiar people or animals, and are generally not threatening in nature. Some patients find them comforting; however, their caregivers often find this part of the disease most disturbing, and the occurrence of hallucinations is a major risk factor for hospitalisation. Treatment options consist of modifying the dosage of dopaminergic drugs taken each day, adding an antipsychotic drug such as quetiapine, or offering caregivers a psychosocial intervention to help them cope with the hallucinations.\n\nSleep\n\nSleep problems can be worsened by medications for PD, but they are a core feature of the disease. Sleep dysfunction in PD has significant negative impacts on both patient and carer quality of life. Some common symptoms are:\n\nGastrointestinal\n\nParkinson's Disease causes constipation and gastric dysmotility that is severe enough to endanger comfort and even health. A factor in this is the appearance of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites even before these affect the functioning of the substantia nigra in the neurons in the enteric nervous system that control gut functions.\n\nNeuro-ophthalmological\n\nPD is related to different ophthalmological abnormalities produced by the neurological changes. Among them are:",
  "NdeI\n\nNdeI is an endonuclease isolated from Neisseria denitrificans.\n\nIn molecular biology, it is commonly used as a restriction enzyme.\n\nRecognition sequence\n\nRecognition sequence of NdeI:\n\n5'CATATG 3'GTATAC\n\nThe ends generated by NdeI digest:\n\n5'---CA    TATG---3' 3'---GTAT    AC---5'\n\nUse in molecular biology\n\nNdeI is a specific Type II restriction enzyme that cuts open specific target sequences, unlike exonucleases. This enzyme is used in gene cloning to cut open reading frames in the plasmid of certain bacteria such as E. coli and insert a foreign gene, such as the gfpuv gene that codes for bio fluorescence of the jelly fish Aequorea victoria.\n\nNdeI is useful in generating heterologous DNA construct because it contains the start codon ATG. It therefore can be used in some expression vectors, such as those in the pET series of vectors, for the ligation of the start of a gene when making an expression construct. Note however that NdeI generates only a two-base overhang and therefore has a lower melting temperature than other restriction enzymes that generate a four-base overhang. It has a lower ligation efficiency, since ligation is affected by the ability of the ends to anneal and a two-base overhang has a significantly lower melting temperature compared to a 4-base overhang. Ligation of NdeI-generated ends is therefore best performed with higher ligase concentration with a longer ligation time, whether at room temperature, 14-16\u00b0C, or at 4\u00b0C.",
  "807 Naval Air Squadron\n\n807 Naval Air Squadron (807 NAS) was a Naval Air Squadron of the Royal Navy.\n\nSecond World War\n\n807 Squadron was formed at RNAS Worthy Down in September 1940, equipped with Fairey Fulmar Is. Three were embarked on HMS Pegasus, where they remained until February 1941, when the entire squadron embarked on for convoy duties. Re-equipped with Fulmar IIs in April 1941, 807 Squadron joined and saw action defending the Malta convoys between July and September. Many of the squadron's aircraft were lost in the sinking of Ark Royal in November 1941. Four surviving machines were flown off to North Front, Gibraltar. The squadron was gradually re-equipped with replacement Fulmars, which were joined by Sea Hurricanes, after which the squadron joined. In June 1942 the squadron flew off the carriers HMS Argus and to cover Operation Harpoon.\n\n807 Squadron received Supermarine Seafires in June 1942, and rejoined HMS Furious in August. They took part in Operation Torch, the North African landings, and by March 1943 were back in the UK. By May 1943 the squadron had been assigned to and provided cover for the Allied invasion of Sicily. Indomitable was damaged by a torpedo in July, causing 807 Squadron to transfer to, from which they supported the Allied invasion of Italy. The squadron returned to Britain aboard, subsequently joining the 4th Naval Fighter Wing.\n\nElements of the squadron were lent to the Desert Air Force serving in Italy for several weeks in April 1944, with the entire squadron flying off HMS Hunter to support Operation Dragoon, the landings in the South of France in August 1944. In March 1945 the squadron joined the Eastern Fleet aboard HMS Hunter and provided cover during the re-occupation of Rangoon, and attacks on enemy shipping in the Andaman Sea.\n\nRecommissioning\n\nThe squadron was recommissioned on 1 October 1958 at RNAS Lossiemouth under the command of Lieutenant Commander Keith Leppard. 807 NAS immediately began a hectic work up period and participated in a major exercise 15 days after commissioning. 807 remained at Lossiemouth throughout 1959, working up and taking part in exercises and trials.\n\nAerobatic displays\n\nIn September 1959 the squadron performed in front of thousands of spectators at Farnborough Airshow with a display of formation aerobatics. The naval aviators began their display with a six stream takeoff to form a four aircraft aerobatic team and two soloists. One of the singletons performed a target banner pick up using an extension fitted to its deck arrestor hook. Meanwhile, the four aircraft formation returned for a transonic pass at 700 mph followed by a short aerobatic display devised by Keith Leppard.\n\nIncluded in this sequence was what the Naval commentator described as an 'original manoeuvre', a fast pass in open box formation with a rapid individual roll by each Supermarine Scimitar; the Twinkle Roll was created. The two singletons touched down from the left and immediately folded their wings whilst one aircraft from the other four detached and approached from the right, landing head on between them.\n\nShip-based service\n\nOn 10 November 1959 Lieutenant N. Grier-Rees RN carried out a successful ejection from a Scimitar when his flying controls locked. The squadron finally embarked on HMS Ark Royal on 3 March 1960 where it remained for the next year, taking part in major exercises and carrying out cold weather trials in the Arctic Circle. In March 1961, 807 transferred from Ark Royal to HMS Centaur. Scimitar operations from this ship proved difficult due to her small size and slower speed than Ark Royal, resulting in restrictions on launch and recovery weights. This prevented them from being used to their limits; problems that became more acute in tropical climates with little or no natural wind.\n\nBefore leaving for the Far East in October 1961 the aircraft were modified to carry AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles and AGM-12 Bullpup air-to-ground missiles. The latter were command guided by a joystick in the cockpit of the launching aircraft. Flight refuelling capability was also added at this time. On 21 October 1961 Lieutenant P.M. Hessey fired the first successful live Sidewinder from a British aircraft when he destroyed a meteor target aircraft over the Aberporth Ranges. After seven months in the Middle and Far East 807 NAS disbanded aboard Centaur in Portsmouth on 17 May 1962.",
  "Rob Swire\n\nRobert Swire-Thompson (born 5 November 1982) is an Australian musician, singer, songwriter, record producer and DJ, best known as the founder and vocalist of the drum and bass and electronic rock band Pendulum, as well as DJ and co-founder of electro house duo Knife Party formed of Swire and Gareth McGrillen. Originally from Perth, Western Australia, he relocated to the United Kingdom in 2003 with fellow Pendulum co-founders Gareth McGrillen and Paul \"El Hornet\" Harding. Swire has since fulfilled a broad spectrum of roles as a member of Pendulum, ranging from songwriting to singing while performing live with an unusual guitar-like MIDI controller \u2013 Starr Labs' Ztar Z6S-XPA. Swire also plays guitar, bass, keyboards, percussion, and other instruments. He is sometimes referred to by the stage name Anscenic.\n\nEarly life\n\nRob Swire was born and raised in Perth, Western Australia. When he was a child, his family lived in Harare in Zimbabwe for five years. During his residence, he created a song which was played on a local Zimbabwe radio station. He went to Scotch College, Swanbourne, graduating in 1999, where he first met bandmate Gareth McGrillen. Over the next three years he worked as a record producer for several local drum and bass, breakbeat and metal bands, during which time he occasionally used the stage name \"Anscenic\". He also made a couple of independent releases with former hardcore techno label Hardline Rekordingz, including a collaboration with the label's founder, Animal Intelligence, which was titled \"Fat American Bitchcore\". Only twenty lathe cut copies of the record were distributed, to help promote the label's 2001\u20132002 tour of New Zealand. Swire also produced a track titled \"Electrodes on the Skull\" which was released alongside three tracks by other artists signed to the label at that time.\n\nPendulum\n\nIn 2002, Swire formed drum and bass act Pendulum with fellow Xygen bandmate McGrillen and local DJ Paul \"El Hornet\" Harding. Swire relocated to the United Kingdom the following year, along with the other members of the band, and the band soon gained widespread underground recognition for their tracks \"Vault\" and \"Trail of Sevens\". Over the next two years Swire worked on material for the band's debut album, Hold Your Colour, primarily as the band's songwriter and producer alongside McGrillen. The album was released in 2005, to considerable commercial success. When the band began performing live in October 2006, Swire became the band's lead singer in addition to playing a Ztar \u2013 a guitar-like MIDI controller \u2013 during live performances.\n\nAfter the band's first tour they started work on a second album, In Silico, for which Swire featured as the main vocalist, after already appearing on tracks such as \"Spiral\", \"Hold Your Colour\", \"Streamline\", and \"Still Grey\" in order to keep a consistent sound. In addition, he continued his former roles of writer and producer, although he delegated the task of vocal mixing to a professional mixing engineer. Swire was also extensively involved in creating publicity material for the new album, as he explained during an interview with Lucy Chakaodza of The Independent.\n\nPendulum released their third album titled Immersion in the UK on 24 May 2010. This is Pendulum's only number one album, topping the UK Albums Chart.\n\nPendulum announced on 19 June 2012 that they had split. Swire stated, \"We're having too much fun with the Knife Party project. It's also great because Pendulum, towards the end, sort of felt like we were doing it because we had to, and that's never a fun way to do music. Whereas Knife Party is pretty much solely us doing what we want to and if no one likes it we don't care.\" This can be equated to Rob Swire feeling limited to a genre under the band Pendulum, and he has stated publicly over tweets that he hates the restriction that a fan base can bring, he does enjoy continuing to produce music.\n\nOn 22 August 2013, Swire revealed that a new Pendulum album will probably be released sometime in 2014. Despite this, Swire ruled out the possibility of Pendulum performing live again. However, Pendulum reunited at the 2016 Ultra Music Festival in Miami, Florida.\n\nOn 9 January 2017, Pendulum confirmed to be reuniting for a world tour and possibly releasing a new album, with Swire also returning. They performed live at several music festivals internationally throughout 2017.\n\nOn 29 June 2018, Pendulum's album, aptly titled \"The Reworks\" was released, composed solely of remixes from artists such as Skrillex, Moby, Pegboard Nerds, Noisia and the Knife Party alias. Remixes from Noisia, Knife Party, Icarus and Skrillex were released as singles beforehand.\n\nOn 17 September 2020, Pendulum released two singles \"Driver\" and \"Nothing for Free\", making this the first new material in ten years since Immersion. A music video for \"Nothing for Free\" was produced, and the two songs were included in a live set performed by Pendulum at Spitbank Fort on 2 October 2020. Swire indicated that for foreseeable future, Pendulum would continue to gradually release tracks in small chunks similar to the September 2020 release, rather than wait to release an entire album at once. This concluded in early 2021 as the listed songs plus 2 new tracks released in their EP Elemental.\n\nKnife Party\n\nIn 2011, Swire formed the electro house duo with Pendulum co-founder Gareth McGrillen. The duo released their debut EP, 100% No Modern Talking, on 12 December 2011. The group's popularity grew considerably when they released the top 5 hit U.K. single, Antidote, in collaboration with Swedish house trio Swedish House Mafia. The single was released on 16 December 2011, and has now hit over 11 million views on YouTube. \"Internet Friends\", was released as a second single from the EP, but peaked at a lowly number 83 in the U.K Their second EP, Rage Valley, was released on 27 May 2012, and produced three singles, \"Rage Valley\", \"Bonfire\", and \"Centipede\". All of the singles made it onto the U.K. top 100, but none hit the top 40. However, the EP's second single, \"Bonfire\", peaked at number 18 on the Finnish Singles Chart. The duo's third EP, Haunted House, was released on 6 May 2013, and features four tracks: \"Power Glove\", \"LRAD\", \"EDM Death Machine\", and their own VIP mix of \"Internet Friends\", originally from 100% No Modern Talking. The duo has accumulated a large cult following for their distinctive style: With influences of electro house and dubstep on their first EP, their style has grown to include influences from a wider range of styles, such as moombahton (a combination of house and reggaeton music), and drumstep. The Knife Party remix of Swedish House Mafia's \"Save the World\" was Zane Lowe's 'Hottest Record in the World' on 31 May 2011.\n\nIn late 2014, Knife Party released the 12 track album, \"Abandon Ship\". It was released accidentally through iTunes in October, though it was officially supposed to be delayed until November. The album features diverse stylistic influences, from dubstep, to house and notably features some parody work such as \"EDM Trend Machine\", ostensibly mocking certain tropes of contemporary EDM.\n\nIn November 2015, Knife Party released a 4-track EP, Trigger Warning, with three original tracks (\"PLUR Police\", \"Kraken\" with Tom Staar, and \"Parliament Funk\"), alongside a remix of \"PLUR Police\" by Jauz. The originals have heavy influences from various styles of house, while the Jauz remix is more influenced by dubstep.\n\nKnife Party's Tom Morello collaboration, \"Battle Sirens\", was released in September 2016, and it is part of Morello's upcoming album, \"The Atlas Underground\". As a single, it was remixed by Brillz and Ephwurd individually.\n\nKnife Party released their own remix of their Pendulum original \"Blood Sugar\" on 13 April 2018 to mixed reception.\n\nTheir collaboration with Pegboard Nerds, \"Harpoon\", was released as a single on record label Monstercat as part of Pegboard Nerds' Full Hearts EP on 26 July 2018.\n\nThat July, Rob confirmed a new Knife Party EP in 2018 through a Reddit question and answer session.\n\nTheir new EP, Lost Souls, was released in July 2019 and featured remixes by both Muzzy and Annix.\n\nOther work\n\nSwire recorded vocals for Deadmau5's song, \"Ghosts 'n' Stuff\", on 25 November 2008. The song has over 50 million views on YouTube, and reached number 1 on the U.S. dance music charts, and certified 3\u00d7 Platinum in Canada. Swire also co-wrote Rihanna's songs \"Rude Boy\" and \"Roc Me Out\", and contributed bass guitar and backing vocals to the songs. He has also released three other singles in collaboration with other artists: 2006's \"Nervous (Creep",
  "Bell-bottoms\n\nBell-bottoms (or flares) are a style of trousers that become wider from the knees downward, forming a bell-like shape of the trouser leg.\n\nNaval origins\n\nIn the early 19th century, when a standardized uniform did not yet exist in the U.S. Navy, some sailors adopted a style of wide trousers ending in bell-shaped cuffs. In 1813, one of the first recorded descriptions of sailors' uniforms, written by Commodore Stephen Decatur, noted that the men on the frigates United States and Macedonia were wearing \"glazed canvas hats with stiff brims, decked with streamers of ribbon, blue jackets buttoned loosely over waistcoats, and blue trousers with bell bottoms.\"\n\nThe British Royal Navy had often been a leader in nautical fashion, but bell-bottoms did not become part of the standard uniform until the mid-19th century. These \"bell-bottoms\" were often just very wide-legged trousers, rather than shaped trousers that flared below the knee. They continued in use as a distinctive feature of the RN rating's \"square rig\" uniform until replaced by more conventionally flared trousers in 1977.\n\nAlthough the trousers of the present-day uniform of the United States Navy are still referred to as \"bell-bottomed\", they simply have large straight legs. The wearer's thigh fills the upper trouser leg, making the bottom of the pants leg appear flared. This style has been popular for many years, perhaps originally because the trouser leg can be rolled up easily, allowing the wearer to work in bare feet, but there is no reliable documentation that confirms a specific timeline or reason for the popularity of bell-bottomed trousers in naval apparel.\n\nSome modern naval uniforms continue to use bell-bottomed trousers as a potential life-saving device. The trouser material is made of cotton fibers that swell when wet and can hold air. In the event of a sailor falling overboard or having to abandon ship without a life vest, the bell-bottomed trousers can be quickly removed in the water without having to remove footwear. As part of their survival training, sailors are taught to remove the trousers while floating, tie the leg bottoms in a knot, and then use one of several methods to inflate the trousers with air. The inflated trousers can provide extra flotation while awaiting rescue.\n\nOther traditional usages\n\nBell-bottoms have also been worn for centuries by European carpenters, which is explained by the fact that the widening legs prevent sawdust from falling onto their shoes or feet. Bell-bottoms are still worn by carpenters who decide to spend their time after the apprenticeship as journeymen on the road.\n\n1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s\n\nIn the 1960s bell-bottoms became fashionable for both men and women in London and expanded into Europe and North America. Often made of denim, they flared out from the bottom of the calf, and had slightly curved hems and a circumference of 18 in at the bottom of each leg opening. They were usually worn with Cuban-heeled shoes, clogs, or Chelsea boots. Toni Basil, who was a go-go dancer when the 1964 concert film the T.A.M.I. Show was released, appeared in the film wearing bell-bottoms with a baby doll blouse. Bell-bottoms are mentioned in the popular 1971 music single \"Bell Bottom Blues\" by blues-rock group Derek and the Dominos.\n\nIn the 1970s, bell-bottoms moved back into mainstream fashion via Brian Spiller; Sonny and Cher helped popularize bell-bottoms in the US by wearing them on their popular television show. The pants were typically flared from the knee down, with bottom leg openings of up to twenty-six inches. Made from denim, bright cotton and satin polyester, they were so popular that they became a symbol of the outlandish and colorful style of the decade.\n\nLoon pants (shortened from \"balloon pants\") were a variant on bell-bottomed trousers, with an increased flare. They were worn occasionally by go-go dancers on the British television music variety show Ready Steady Go! in 1966.\n\nElephant bells, popular in the mid-to-late 1970s, were similar to loon pants, but were typically made of denim. Elephant bells had a marked flare below the knee, often covering the wearer's shoes. The preferred shoes were platform shoes with soles at least 2 in thick and heels 4 to 5 in to keep the pants' hems off the ground.\n\nAfter the rise of punk rock in the late 1970s, bell-bottoms began to become less-fashionable as the decade drew to a close. By 1979, skin-tight trousers or 1950s-style drain pipes were much more in vogue, with bell-bottoms been seen as having had their day, remaining in fashion circa 1967\u20131979.\n\nA revival of bell-bottoms occurred after bands such as The Stone Roses, Happy Mondays and The Charlatans re-introduced them in late 1989 and the early 1990s.\n\nMid-1990s to 2000s\n\nIn 1996, women's bell-bottoms were reintroduced to the mainstream public, under the name \"boot-cut\" (or \"bootleg\" ) trousers as the flare was slimmer. By 1999, flare jeans had come into vogue among women, which had a wider, more exaggerated flare than boot-cuts. The boot-cut style ended up dominating the fashion world for 10 years.\n\nBy around 2006, the bell-shaped silhouette started to fade as the skinny jean rose in popularity. Sharon Haver, the founder and editor-in-chief of online fashion magazine FocusOnStyle.com, commented \"It's as if all the girls wearing premium boot-cut jeans threw them away one day, and the next day began wearing skinny jeans and flats.\"\n\nWomen's boot-cut jeans are tighter at the knee than men's, and flare out from knee to hem. Men's styles are traditionally straight-legged, although the pants came in a more flared style in the early and mid 2000s, but this was optional. The bell-bottoms of the 1960s and 1970s can be distinguished from the flare or boot-cut of the 1990s and 2000s by the tightness of the fabric at the knee.",

  "Seth McKeel\n\nSeth McKeel (born June 5, 1975) was a Republican member of the Florida House of Representatives from 2006 to 2014, representing the 63rd District from 2006 to 2012 and the 40th District, which included most of metropolitan Lakeland in Polk County, from 2012 to 2014.\n\nHistory\n\nMcKeel attended the University of Florida, where he graduated in 1997 with a degree in political science. He studied British politics abroad in the United Kingdom at the Florida State University London Study Centre. In 2000, McKeel was elected to the Lakeland City Commission, where he served until December 2005.\n\nFlorida House of Representatives\n\nIn 2006, incumbent State Representative Dennis A. Ross opted to run for re-election in the 64th District rather than the 63rd, where he had previously been elected, creating an open seat. McKeel opted to run in the 63rd District, which included much of western Polk County and southeastern Hillsborough County and won the Republican primary unopposed. In the general election, he campaigned on \"small business regulation and education\" and faced massage therapist James Davis, the Democratic nominee, who shared a name with the unsuccessful Democratic nominee for Governor, Jim Davis; McKeel took the name association seriously, noting that he was \"nervous about what his opponent's name might mean on a night when Democrats were doing well across the country.\" However, he was ultimately successful over Davis, winning with over 60% of the vote. In both 2008 and 2010, McKeel was elected unopposed.\n\nFollowing the reconfiguration of legislative districts in 2012, McKeel was drawn into the 40th District, which was based entirely in Polk County and included most of metropolitan Lakeland. He won the nomination of his party unopposed and advanced to the general election, where he was opposed by independent candidate Lillian Lima. His opponent largely campaigned on replacing most politicians with fresher faces, while McKeel defended his record, noting, \"I ran my first campaign on my vision for my hometown and a deeply rooted belief in limited government and fiscal conservatism. That record is very public, and I am proud of it.\" Ultimately, McKeel turned away Lima's challenge, winning election to his final term in the legislature with 64% of the vote.\n\nWhen Chief Financial Officer of Florida Jeff Atwater was under consideration to be President of the Florida Atlantic University in 2014, when he was running for re-election, McKeel was considered a possible candidate to replace Atwater on the ballot as the Republican nominee. Ultimately, however, Atwater was not selected and instead successfully ran for re-election.",
  "Bag of Trix\n\nBag of Trix (subtitled Music from the Roxette Vaults) is the third box set compilation by Swedish pop duo Roxette. It was issued physically by Roxette Recordings and Parlophone on 11 December 2020, as a quadruple LP and triple CD set. The record consists of 47 tracks, 28 of which are previously unreleased, and features demos, alternate mixes, bonus tracks, live recordings and Spanish-language versions. Also included are several radio versions of singles, including Brian Malouf's CHR mix of \"Joyride\", which was the version predominantly played on US radio when the track peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in May 1991.\n\nThe record was dedicated to Marie Fredriksson, and was issued physically two days after the first anniversary of her death. It contains eleven songs either written or co-written by her. Prior to its physical release, the compilation was issued digitally in volumes from 30 October; these volumes were released in two week intervals, and utilised the track listings found on the vinyl editions.\n\nFour singles were issued from the album: a version of the Beatles song \"Help!\" recorded at Abbey Road Studios in 1995, the Baladas en Espa\u00f1ol outtake \"T\u00fa No Me Comprendes\", and two outtakes from the band's final studio album Good Karma, \"Let Your Heart Dance with Me\" and \"Piece of Cake\".\n\nRelease and promotion\n\nFour songs were issued as singles prior to the release of the album. A cover version of the Beatles song \"Help!\" \u2013 originally recorded in 1995 at Abbey Road Studios \u2013 was issued as the lead single in May 2020. This recording remained unreleased for several years before finally appearing on the 2006 box set The Rox Box/Roxette 86\u201306. Per Gessle, a dedicated Beatles fan, said of the cover: \"When we were in Abbey Road we could not help but make our own version of 'Help!'. It was a great day, pop history in all corners of the studio and a fantastic feeling to be part of Abbey Road's unimaginable legacy.\" The duo also recorded versions of three previous singles at Abbey Road: \"Listen to Your Heart\", \"The Look\" and \"You Don't Understand Me\", all of which appear on Bag of Trix.\n\nThe Good Karma outtake \"Let Your Heart Dance with Me\" was released as a single on 2 October. A music video was created, using footage compiled from Gessle and Fredriksson's private archives, and a limited edition gold-coloured 7\" vinyl was released on 9 October. It contained their cover of \"Help!\" as the b-side. This was followed on 6 November by \"T\u00fa No Me Comprendes\", a previously unreleased version of their 1995 single \"You Don't Understand Me\" originally recorded for their Spanish-language compilation Baladas en Espa\u00f1ol in 1996. Another Good Karma outtake, \"Piece of Cake\", was released on 20 November. Music videos were also created for the preceding two singles, both consisting of archive footage.\n\nCritical reception\n\nA writer for Sweden's largest newspaper Aftonbladet said the album demonstrates how Fredriksson and Gessle were \"intensely passionate about the music they made, and had a lot of fun together in the meantime\". They praised the demo version of \"Hotblooded\" as one of the \"most joyful\" songs Roxette ever recorded, saying the track sounds \"spontaneous and playful, even if their musical perfection is still present.\" They also praised Fredriksson's vocals, saying it \"does not matter how many times you have heard it before, you can still and consistently be struck by Marie Fredriksson's enormous voice. The sharpness in it is striking, especially in the live recording of the ballad 'Cry' from Norrk\u00f6ping in the winter of 1988. It is one of the album's main gems, because it so nicely captures the audience's great reaction.\" They summarised by describing the compilation as \"not being about the band's best or most beautiful recordings. The collection has a different, more nostalgic value. Above all, it is an opportunity for fans to get close to Roxette for perhaps the last time.\"\n\nFormats and track listings\n\nAll songs written by Per Gessle, except where noted.\n\nPersonnel\n\nCredits adapted from Tidal.\n\nTechnical personnel\n\nAdditional personnel",

  "Novelization\n\nA novelization (or novelisation) is a derivative novel that adapts the story of a work created for another medium, such as a film, TV series, stage play, comic book or video game. Film novelizations were particularly popular before the advent of home video, but continue to find commercial success as part of marketing campaigns for major films. They are often written by accomplished writers based on an early draft of the film's script and on a tight deadline.\n\nHistory and purpose\n\nNovelizations of films began to be produced in the 1910s and 1920s for silent films such as Les Vampires (1915\u201316) and London After Midnight (1927). One of the first films with spoken dialogue to be novelized was King Kong (1933). Film novelizations were especially profitable during the 1970s before home video became available, as they were then the only way to re-experience popular movies other than television airing or a rerelease in theaters. The novelizations of Star Wars (1977), Alien (1979) and Star Trek:The Motion Picture (1979) sold millions of copies.\n\nThe first ever video game to be novelised was Shadowkeep, in 1984.\n\nEven after the advent of home video, film novelizations remain popular, with the adaptation of Godzilla (2014) being included on The New York Times Best Seller list for mass-market paperbacks. This has been attributed to these novels' appeal to fans: About 50% of novelizations are sold to people who have watched the film and want to explore its characters further, or to reconnect to the enthusiasm they experienced when watching the film. A film is therefore also a sort of commercial for its novelization; the film's success or failure affects the novelization's sales. Conversely, film novelizations help generate publicity for upcoming films, serving as a link in the film's marketing chain.\n\nAccording to publishing industry estimates, about one or two percent of the audience of a film will buy its novelization. This makes these relatively inexpensively produced works a commercially attractive proposition in the case of blockbuster film franchises. The increasing number of previously established novelists taking on tie-in works has been credited with these works gaining a \"patina of respectability\" after they had previously been disregarded in literary circles as derivative and mere merchandise.\n\nFilm\n\nThe writer of a novelization is supposed to multiply the 20,000\u201325,000 words of a screenplay into at least 60,000 words. Writers usually achieve that by adding description or introspection. Ambitious writers are driven to work on transitions and characters just to accomplish \"a more prose-worthy format\". Sometimes the \"novelizer\" invents new scenes in order to give the plot \"added dimension\", provided they are allowed to do that. Publishers aim to have novelizations in shops before a film is released, which means it is usually necessary to base the novelization on a screenplay instead of the completed film. It might take an insider to tell whether a novelization diverges unintentionally from the final film because it is based on an earlier version which included deleted scenes. Thus the novelization occasionally presents material which will later on appear in a director's cut. In some cases, separate novelizations of the same film are written for publication in different countries, and these may be based on different drafts of the screenplay, as was very clearly the case with the American and British novelizations of Capricorn One. Writers select different approaches to enrich a screenplay. Dewey Gram's Gladiator, for example, included historical background information.\n\nIf a film is based on a novel, the original novel is generally reissued with a cover based on the film's poster. If a film company also wishes to have a separate novelization published, the company is supposed to approach the author who has \"Separated Rights\". A writer has these rights if he contributed the source material (or added a great deal of creative input to it) and if he was moreover properly credited.\n\nNovelizations also exist where the film itself is based on an original novel: novelist and screenwriter Christopher Wood wrote a novelization of the James Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me. Although the 1962 Ian Fleming novel was still available in bookstores, its story had nothing to do with the 1977 film. To avoid confusion, Wood's novelization was titled James Bond, The Spy Who Loved Me. This novel is also an example of a screenwriter novelizing his own screenplay. Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker was published under the name of George Lucas but his script had been novelized by the prolific tie-in writer Alan Dean Foster.\n\nAcquiring editors looking for a novelizer have different issues. The author may not have all of the information needed; Foster wrote the Alien novelization without knowing what the Xenomorph looked like. The contract may be very restrictive; Max Allan Collins had to write the novelization for Road to Perdition only based on the film, without the detail he had created for the graphic novel of the same name that the film is based on. Rewrites of scripts may force last-minute novelization rewrites. The script for the 1966 film Modesty Blaise was rewritten by five different authors. The writer or script doctor responsible for the so-called \"final\" version is not necessarily the artist who has contributed the original idea or most of the scenes. The patchwork character of a film script might even exacerbate because the film director, a principal actor or a consulting script doctor does rewrites during the shooting. An acquiring editor who intends to hire one of the credited screenwriters has to reckon that the early writers are no longer familiar with the current draft or work already on another film script. Not every screenwriter is available, willing to work for less money than what can be earned with film scripts and able to deliver the required amount of prose on time. Even if so, there is still the matter of novelizations having a questionable reputation. The International Association of Media Tie-In Writers concedes that by saying their craft is \"largely unrecognized\". Writers Guild of America rules require that screenwriters have right of first refusal to write novelizations of their own films, but they rarely do so because of the lack of prestige and money.\n\nSome novels blur the line between a novelization and an original novel that is the basis of a film adaptation. Arthur C. Clarke provided the ideas for Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. Based on his own short stories and his cooperation with Kubrick during the preparation and making of this film adaptation he wrote the film novelization of the same name which is appreciated by fans because the film provides little exposition, and the novelization fills in some blanks. David Morrell wrote the novel First Blood about John Rambo, which led to the film adaptation of the same name. Although Rambo dies at the end of his original story, Morrell had a paragraph in his contract stipulating he remained \"the only person who could write books about Rambo\". This paid off for him when the film producers changed the ending and decided for a sequel. David Morrell accepted to carry out the novelization and negotiated unprecedented liberties which resulted in a likewise unprecedented success when his book entered The New York Times Best Seller list and stayed there for six weeks.\n\nSimon Templar or James Bond are examples of media franchises that have been popular for more than one generation. When the feature film The Saint was released in 1997 the creator of this character (Leslie Charteris) had already been dead for four years. Hence its novelization had to be written by another author. Ian Fleming on the other hand had official successors who wrote contemporary \"Post-Fleming\" James Bond novels. During his tenure John Gardner was consequently chosen to write the novelization of Licence to Kill in 1989 and also the novelization of GoldenEye in 1995. John Gardner found his successor in Raymond Benson who wrote besides several original Bond novels three novelizations including The World Is Not Enough.\n\nComics\n\nWhile comic books such as the series Classics Illustrated have often provided adaptations of novels, novelizations of comics are relatively rare.\n\nVideo games\n\nVideo games are novelized in the same manner as films. While gamers might enjoy playing a certain action scene for hours, the buyers of a novelization might be bored soon if they merely read about such a scene. Consequently, the writer will have to cut down on the action.\n\nAuthors\n\nNovelization writers are often also accomplished original fiction writers, as well as fans of the works they adapt, which helps motivate them to undertake a commission that is generally compensated with a relatively low flat fee. Alan Dean Foster, for example, said that, as a fan, \"I got to make my own director's cut. I got to fix the science mistakes, I got to enlarge on the characters, if there was a scene I particularly liked, I got to do more of it, and I had an unlimited budget. So it was fun\".\n\nWriting skill is particularly needed for challenging situations common to writing novelizations of popular media, such as lack of access to information about the film, last-minute script changes and very quick turnaround times. Collins had to write the novelization of In the Line of Fire in nine days.\n\nAlthough novelizations tend to have a low prestige, and are often viewed as \"hackwork\", several critically acclaimed literary authors have written novelizations, including, Arthur Calder-Marshall, William Kotzwinkle and Richard Elman. Best-selling author Ken Follett, early in his career, also wrote a novelization, and so did Isaac Asimov, later in his career. While increasingly also a domain of previously established novelists, tie-in writing still has the disadvantages, from the writers' point of view, of modest pay",

  "Fine-tuned universe\n\nThe characterization of the universe as finely tuned suggests that the occurrence of life in the universe is very sensitive to the values of certain fundamental physical constants and that the observed values are, for some reason, improbable. If the values of any of certain free parameters in contemporary physical theories had differed only slightly from those observed, the evolution of the Universe would have proceeded very differently and life as it is understood may not have been possible.\n\nHistory\n\nIn 1913, the chemist Lawrence Joseph Henderson wrote The Fitness of the Environment, one of the first books to explore fine tuning in the universe. Henderson discusses the importance of water and the environment to living things, pointing out that life depends entirely on earth's very specific environmental conditions, especially the prevalence and properties of water.\n\nIn 1961, physicist Robert H. Dicke claimed that certain forces in physics, such as gravity and electromagnetism, must be perfectly fine-tuned for life to exist in the universe. Fred Hoyle also argued for a fine-tuned universe in his 1984 book The Intelligent Universe. \"The list of anthropic properties, apparent accidents of a non-biological nature without which carbon-based and hence human life could not exist, is large and impressive\", Hoyle wrote.\n\nBelief in the fine-tuned universe led to the expectation that the Large Hadron Collider would produce evidence of physics beyond the Standard Model, such as supersymmetry, but by 2012 it had not produced evidence for supersymmetry at the energy scales it was able to probe.\n\nMotivation\n\nPhysicist Paul Davies has said, \"There is now broad agreement among physicists and cosmologists that the Universe is in several respects \u2018fine-tuned' for life\". However, he continued, \"the conclusion is not so much that the Universe is fine-tuned for life; rather it is fine-tuned for the building blocks and environments that life requires.\" He has also said that anthropic' reasoning fails to distinguish between minimally biophilic universes, in which life is permitted, but only marginally possible, and optimally biophilic universes, in which life flourishes because biogenesis occurs frequently\". Among scientists who find the evidence persuasive, a variety of natural explanations have been proposed, such as the existence of multiple universes introducing a survivorship bias under the anthropic principle.\n\nThe premise of the fine-tuned universe assertion is that a small change in several of the physical constants would make the universe radically different. As Stephen Hawking has noted, \"The laws of science, as we know them at present, contain many fundamental numbers, like the size of the electric charge of the electron and the ratio of the masses of the proton and the electron.... The remarkable fact is that the values of these numbers seem to have been very finely adjusted to make possible the development of life.\"\n\nIf, for example, the strong nuclear force were 2% stronger than it is (i.e. if the coupling constant representing its strength were 2% larger) while the other constants were left unchanged, diprotons would be stable; according to Davies, hydrogen would fuse into them instead of deuterium and helium. This would drastically alter the physics of stars, and presumably preclude the existence of life similar to what we observe on Earth. The diproton's existence would short-circuit the slow fusion of hydrogen into deuterium. Hydrogen would fuse so easily that it is likely that all the universe's hydrogen would be consumed in the first few minutes after the Big Bang. This \"diproton argument\" is disputed by other physicists, who calculate that as long as the increase in strength is less than 50%, stellar fusion could occur despite the existence of stable diprotons.\n\nThe precise formulation of the idea is made difficult by the fact that we do not yet know how many independent physical constants there are. The standard model of particle physics has 25 freely adjustable parameters and general relativity has one more, the cosmological constant, which is known to be nonzero but profoundly small in value. But because physicists have not developed an empirically successful theory of quantum gravity, there is no known way to combine quantum mechanics, on which the standard model depends, and general relativity. Without knowledge of this more complete theory suspected to underlie the standard model, it is impossible to definitively count the number of truly independent physical constants. In some candidate theories, the number of independent physical constants may be as small as one. For example, the cosmological constant may be a fundamental constant, but attempts have also been made to calculate it from other constants, and according to the author of one such calculation, \"the small value of the cosmological constant is telling us that a remarkably precise and totally unexpected relation exists among all the parameters of the Standard Model of particle physics, the bare cosmological constant and unknown physics.\"\n\nExamples\n\nMartin Rees formulates the fine-tuning of the universe in terms of the following six dimensionless physical constants.\n\nCarbon and oxygen\n\nAn older example is the Hoyle state, the third-lowest energy state of the carbon-12 nucleus, with an energy of 7.656 MeV above the ground level. According to one calculation, if the state's energy level were lower than 7.3 or greater than 7.9 MeV, insufficient carbon would exist to support life. Furthermore, to explain the universe's abundance of carbon, the Hoyle state must be further tuned to a value between 7.596 and 7.716 MeV. A similar calculation, focusing on the underlying fundamental constants that give rise to various energy levels, concludes that the strong force must be tuned to a precision of at least 0.5%, and the electromagnetic force to a precision of at least 4%, to prevent either carbon production or oxygen production from dropping significantly.\n\nExplanations\n\nSome explanations of fine-tuning are naturalistic. First, the fine-tuning might be an illusion: more fundamental physics may explain the apparent fine-tuning in physical parameters in our current understanding by constraining the values those parameters are likely to take. As Lawrence Krauss puts it, \"certain quantities have seemed inexplicable and fine-tuned, and once we understand them, they don\u2019t seem to be so fine-tuned. We have to have some historical perspective.\" Some argue it is possible that a final fundamental theory of everything will explain the underlying causes of the apparent fine-tuning in every parameter.\n\nStill, as modern cosmology developed, various hypotheses not presuming hidden order have been proposed. One is a multiverse, where fundamental physical constants are postulated to have different values outside of our own universe. On this hypothesis, separate parts of reality would have wildly different characteristics. In such scenarios, the appearance of fine-tuning is explained as a consequence of the weak anthropic principle and selection bias (specifically survivorship bias); only those universes with fundamental constants hospitable to life (such as ours) could contain life forms capable of observing the universe and contemplating the question of fine-tuning in the first place.\n\nMultiverse\n\nIf the universe is just one of many, and possibly infinite universes, each with different physical phenomena and constants, it would be unsurprising that we find ourselves in a universe hospitable to intelligent life (see multiverse: anthropic principle). Some versions of the multiverse hypothesis therefore provide a simple explanation for any fine-tuning.\n\nThe multiverse idea has led to considerable research into the anthropic principle and has been of particular interest to particle physicists, because theories of everything do apparently generate large numbers of universes in which the physical constants vary widely. As yet, there is no evidence for the existence of a multiverse, but some versions of the theory make predictions of which some researchers studying M-theory and gravity leaks hope to see some evidence soon. Laura Mersini-Houghton claimed that the WMAP cold spot could provide testable empirical evidence for a parallel universe. Variants of this approach include Lee Smolin's notion of cosmological natural selection, the Ekpyrotic universe, and the bubble universe theory.\n\nTop-down cosmology\n\nStephen Hawking and Thomas Hertog proposed that the universe's initial conditions consisted of a superposition of many possible initial conditions, only a small fraction of which contributed to the conditions we see today. On their theory, it is inevitable that we find our universe's \"fine-tuned\" physical constants, as the current universe \"selects\" only those past histories that led to the present conditions. In this way, top-down cosmology provides an anthropic explanation for why we find ourselves in a universe that allows matter and life, without invoking the ontic existence of the Multiverse.\n\nCarbon chauvinism\n\nSome forms of fine-tuning arguments about the formation of life assume that only carbon-based life forms are possible, an assumption sometimes called carbon chauvinism. Conceptually, alternative biochemistry, the discovery of unknown chemical elements, or other forms of life consisting of unknown biochemistries are all possible.\n\nAlien design\n\nOne hypothesis is that extra-universal aliens designed the universe. Some believe this would solve the problem of how a designer or design team capable of fine-tuning the universe could come to exist. Cosmologist Alan Guth believes humans will in time be able to generate new universes. By implication, previous intelligent entities may have generated our universe. This idea leads to the possibility that the extra-universal designer/designers are themselves the product of an evolutionary process in their own universe, which must therefore itself be able to sustain life. It also raises the question of where that universe came from, leading to an infinite regress.\n\nJohn Gribbin's Designer Universe theory suggests that an advanced civilization could have deliberately made the universe in another part of the Multiverse, and that this civilization may have caused the Big Bang.",
  "Inuyasha the Movie: Affections Touching Across Time\n\nInuyasha the Movie: Affections Touching Across Time is a 2001 Japanese animated fantasy adventure film based on Inuyasha manga series written and illustrated by Rumiko Takahashi. The film is directed by Toshiya Shinohara, written by Katsuyuki Sumisawa, and produced by Sunrise. The film was released in Japan on December 15, 2001.\n\nThe film tells the story of Inuyasha and his friends confronting a demonic moth warrior named Menomaru, who was brought back to life by one of the shards of the Shikon Jewel.\n\nThe film marks the very first film for the Inuyasha series, followed up by The Castle Beyond the Looking Glass (2002).\n\nPlot\n\nHalf-demon Inuyasha's late dog-demon father Toga defeated a powerful Chinese moth y\u014dkai, named Hy\u014dga two centuries ago, but a Shikon Jewel fragment has freed his son, Men\u014dmaru, who seeks to avenge his father's death and free the tremendously infinite power and strength of his father sealed away with him.\n\nIn the present of Feudal-era Japan, Inuyasha, and his friends, Kagome, monk Miroku, demon slayer Sango and fox demon Shippo, have just finished killing a scorpion demon. Miroku and Sango split up from the group after Sango's faithful nekomata companion Kirara mysteriously runs off, leading them to Men\u014dmaru's cave. Men\u014dmaru and his female minions, Ruri and Hari, begin battling Miroku and Sango, during which Ruri copies Miroku's Wind Tunnel and Hari cursing Kirara, to follow Hari as her leader. Eventually, Men\u014dmaru curses Kagome so she turns against Inuyasha.\n\nAfter the heroes are pushed away by a blast from Men\u014dmaru and further split up, Men\u014dmaru succeeds in accessing the demonic power of his predecessors, sealed away by Inuyasha's father, becoming a new, more powerful Hy\u014dga, and begins to change the essence of time and space by absorbing the souls of countless people to fully merge himself with his family's demonic energy. Men\u014dmaru's mind-control curse on Kagome possesses her, and she is forced to pursue and kill Inuyasha, who notices her wearing Kikyo's style of clothing. After realizing what Men\u014dmaru did to her and choosing to face Kagome at the Sacred Tree, she shoots him with a sacred arrow in the same manner that Kikyo had done. Kagome regains control of herself and mourns her actions, during which Kikyo appears and forces Kagome to return to her own time.\n\nBack in the present, Kagome walks out to see her family shrine, and the rest of Tokyo covered in snow caused by Men\u014dmaru's curse. She goes to the tree that Inuyasha was sealed to, realizing that without a way back to Feudal Japan, that she can never see him again. She places her hand on the tree and discovers that she and Inuyasha are emotionally connected to each other through the tree and can talk to each other through thoughts. After Inuyasha pleads with her to return to the Feudal era, Kagome retrieves a piece of Kikyo's sacred arrow from the tree and shoots it into the well. She returns to the Feudal era to find Inuyasha reawakened, thanks to Shippo, Myoga, and Kaede.\n\nDeciding to face off Men\u014dmaru and his minions alone, Miroku defeats Ruri in a duel with their wind tunnels, and Sango brings Kirara back to her senses, allowing them to defeat Hari. They join Inuyasha, Kagome and Shippo in a last stand against Men\u014dmaru. Inuyasha combines his Backlash Wave with Kagome's sacred arrow to kill Hy\u014dga.\n\nProduction\n\nKatsuyuki Sumisawa and Kaoru Wada from the television series wrote the screenplay and composed the music respectively at Sunrise, while directed by Toshiya Shinohara, and animator Hideyuki Motohashi acted as a character designer and chief animation director for the film. Unlike the television series, which was character designed by Yoshihito Hishinuma, Motohashi modeled the characters very close to original creator and mangaka Rumiko Takahashis art style.\n\nThe theme song, \"No More Words\" is performed by Ayumi Hamasaki.\n\nRelease\n\nThe film was released in Japanese theaters on December 15, 2001.",

  "Naked (Talking Heads album)\n\nNaked is the eighth and final studio album by American rock band Talking Heads, released on March 15, 1988, by Sire Records. Following the more straightforward new wave and pop rock sound on Little Creatures and True Stories, Naked marked a return to the worldbeat stylings of both Remain in Light and Speaking in Tongues, blending elements of Afrobeat, Latin funk, and art pop. The album's songs were formed from improvisational jam sessions recorded in Paris, which featured the participation of numerous guest musicians such as former Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr and singer Kirsty MacColl. Lyrics and vocals were then added in New York City following the Paris recordings.\n\nNaked was positively received by critics, who viewed it as a return to form for the band following the mixed responses to True Stories; retrospective assessments, however, have been more lukewarm. The album was also a moderate commercial success, peaking at No. 19 on the US Billboard 200 and No. 3 on the UK Albums Chart, later being certified gold by both the RIAA and BPI. Following the album's release, Talking Heads officially went on hiatus, with its members focusing on various side-projects over the course of the next few years; frontman David Byrne would eventually announce in December 1991 that the band had dissolved.\n\nRecording\n\nWanting to try something different after their use of regional American music and the pop song format on their previous two albums Little Creatures (1985) and True Stories (1986), Talking Heads decided to record their next album in Paris with a group of international musicians. According to the album's liner notes, the decision to do so was in part a reaction to the foreign policy of the Ronald Reagan administration, which had grown increasingly isolationist in approach. Prior to leaving for France, the band recorded about 40 improvisational tracks that would serve as the foundation for the sessions in Paris.\n\nIn Paris, the band, along with producer Steve Lillywhite, were joined by a number of other musicians in the recording studio where they would rehearse and play for the entire day. At the end of each day, one take was selected as being the ideal version of a particular tune. \"Paris is a wonderful place to work,\" observed drummer Chris Frantz in the liner notes of Once in a Lifetime: The Best of Talking Heads. \"We were really embracing world culture fully.\" In the interest of freedom for the musicians, it was decided that lyrics and melodies would be left until later. The lyrics were not overdubbed until the band returned to New York. Many of David Byrne's lyrics were improvisations sung along with the prerecorded tracks until he found something that he felt worked. In this way, the melodies and lyrics evolved in a similar fashion as the songs themselves. According to Lillywhite, the album's more organic, percussive sound was a deliberate move away from the bombastic production that he had helped make commonplace in the 1980s, stating that \"It wasn't made so angular and mixed so loud as it might have been in the past. It was more of a warm sound with all for the beats compensated for.\"\n\nByrne told Record Mirror in 1988 that many of the songs on Naked are \"about human beings stripped of their pretensions; stripped of their surface trappings\", which in turn inspired putting a picture of a chimpanzee on the album cover.\n\nCritical reception\n\nNaked was well-received by critics, who hailed it as a vast improvement over True Stories. Chris Willman from the Los Angeles Times said the band abandoned \"the stripped-down four-piece rock approach of late\" in favor of a \"far more eclectic big-band, world music extravaganza.\" In Rolling Stone, Anthony DeCurtis called the album \"stylistically bold and intellectually provocative,\" a \"dizzying and disturbing piece of work\" that \"marks a return to the more open-ended, groove-oriented style the Heads defined on Remain in Light.\" He noted that \"the vital human harmony suggested by the international band of players.. is the strongest counterpoint to the album's pervasive themes of alienation and dread.\" He concluded by interpreting the view of the album's lyrics: \"The human race consists of some pretty cool people... but it's got a very destructive monkey on its back. Human survival is not guaranteed. With humor and good-hearted-ness [sic], hope and fear, Talking Heads contemplate a world on the eve of destruction on this important record \u2014 and leave wide open the question of what the dawn will bring.\"\n\nNaked was voted the 24th best album of 1988 in The Village Voices annual Pazz & Jop poll of American critics nationwide. Robert Christgau, the poll's supervisor, regarded it as \"an honest if less than sustaining internationalist gesture\" and said \"Byrne concealed the ricketiness of his current compositional practice by riding in on soukous's jetstream, but the trick didn't stick\", attributing the band's diminished success to a weariness with the music business. In Christgau's Record Guide: The '80s (1990), he wrote, \"where Paul Simon appropriated African musicians, David Byrne just hires them, for better and worse &ndash; this is T. Heads funk heavy on the horns, which aren't fussy or obtrusive because Byrne knew where to get fresh ones. What's African about it from an American perspective is that the words don't matter &ndash; it signifies sonically.\" However, he called, \"(Nothing But) Flowers\" a \"gibe at ecology fetishism that's very reassuring\". Years later, he revised his stance on both Naked and True Stories, \"which I once thought overrated. I was wrong. They sucked.\"\n\nIn a retrospective review, Michael Hastings from AllMusic found Naked \"alternately serious and playful\", allowing Byrne to continue worrying about \"the government, the environment, and the plight of the working man as it frees up the rest of the band to trade instruments and work with guest musicians. It's closest in spirit to Remain in Light &ndash; arguably too close.\" He further stated that \"the album sounds technically perfect, but there's little of the loose, live feel the band achieved with former mentor Brian Eno. It's quite a feat to pull off a late-career album as ambitious as Naked, and the Heads do so with style and vitality.\" He concluded that \"the album's elegiac, airtight tone betrays the sound of four musicians growing tired of the limits they've imposed on one another.\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine said it \"marked a return to their worldbeat explorations, although it sometimes suffered from Byrne's lyrical pretensions.\"\n\nTrack listing\n\nAll lyrics written by David Byrne, all music composed by Byrne, Chris Frantz, Jerry Harrison, and Tina Weymouth.",

  "Bitch (slang)\n\nBitch is a pejorative slang word for a person, usually a woman. When applied to a woman or girl, it means someone who is belligerent, unreasonable, malicious, controlling, aggressive, or dominant. When applied to a man or boy, bitch reverses its meaning and is a derogatory term for being subordinate, weak, or cowardly.\n\nThe term bitch is one of the most common curse words in the English language. It has been used as a \"term of contempt towards women\" for \"over six centuries\", and is a slur that fosters sexism against women. It has been characterized as \"an archaic word demeaning women since as early as the 15th century\" that seeks to control women. The word is considered taboo in mainstream media, and euphemisms such as \"the B-word\" are used to minimize its negative impact.\n\nThe term bitch literally means a female dog. Its original use as a vulgarism carried a meaning suggesting high sexual desire in a woman, comparable to a dog in heat. The range of meanings has expanded in modern usage (such as when applied to a man). In a feminist context, it can indicate a strong or assertive woman and has therefore been reappropriated by some women.\n\nHistory\n\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary, the term bitch comes from the Old English word bicce or bicge, meaning \"female dog\", which dates to around 1000 CE. It may have derived from the earlier Old Norse word bikkja, also meaning \"female dog\".\n\n\"Dog\" has long been used as an insult toward both women and men. In ancient Greece, dog was often used in a derogatory sense to refer to someone whose behavior was improper or transgressive. This could include shamelessness or lack of restraint, lack of hospitality, lack of loyalty, and indiscriminate or excessive violence, among other qualities. Over time, classicist C. Franco argues, a \"persistent symbolic connection\" developed between dogs and women in Greek literature that expressed and reinforced women's subordinate position in society and their supposedly inferior nature.\n\nThere may also be a connection between less literal senses of \"bitch\" and the Greek goddess Artemis. As she is the goddess of the hunt, she was often portrayed with a pack of hunting dogs and sometimes transformed into an animal herself. She was seen as free, vigorous, cold, impetuous, unsympathetic, wild, and beautiful.\n\nThe earliest use of \"bitch\" specifically as a derogatory term for women dates to the fifteenth century. Its earliest slang meaning mainly referred to sexual behavior, according to the English language historian Geoffrey Hughes:\n\nThe early applications were to a promiscuous or sensual woman, a metaphorical extension of the behavior of a bitch in heat. Herein lies the original point of the powerful insult son of a bitch, found as biche sone ca. 1330 in Arthur and Merlin... while in a spirited exchange in the Chester Play (ca. 1400) a character demands: \"Whom callest thou queine, skabde bitch?\" (\"Who are you calling a whore, you miserable bitch?\").\n\nBitch remained a strong insult through the nineteenth century. The entry in Francis Grose's Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue (1785) reads:\n\nA she dog, or doggess; the most offensive appellation that can be given to an English woman, even more provoking than that of whore, as may be gathered from the regular Billinsgate or St Giles answer\u2013\"I may be awhore, but can't be a bitch.\" Throughout the word's evolution into the nineteenth century, it became gradually less offensive. The Oxford English Dictionary in the nineteenth century described the insult as \"strictly a lewd or sensual woman\". The word went through many similar phases throughout history. It was not until the 20th century that feminism began to reevaluate the term and its appropriation.\n\nIn the 1920s, bitch became once again a common insult used against women. The term bitch became more popular in common language during this era. Between 1915 and 1930, the use of \"bitch\" in newspapers and literature more than doubled. The writing of Ernest Hemingway popularized the more modern meaning of \"bitch\" in this era. He used it to represent favorable qualities such as ferocity, edginess, and grit. It was during this time that women began gaining more freedom (such as the right to vote through the Nineteenth Amendment). The word \"bitch\" during the twenties meant \"malicious or consciously attempting to harm\", \"difficult, annoying, or interfering\", and \"sexually brazen or overly vulgar\".\n\nAccording to Dr. Timothy Jay, there are \"over 70 different taboo words\", but 80 percent of the time only ten words are used, and bitch is included in that set. Being called the term bitch has been associated with worsening the mental health of women.\n\nModern use\n\nIn modern usage, the slang term bitch has different meanings depending largely on social context and may vary from very offensive to endearing, and as with many slang terms, its meaning and nuances can vary depending on the region in which it is used.\n\nThe term bitch can refer to a person or thing that is very difficult, as in \"Life's a bitch\" or \"He sure got the bitch end of that deal\". It is common for insults to lose intensity as their meaning broadens (\"bastard\" is another example). In the film The Women (1939), Joan Crawford could only allude to the word: \"And by the way, there's a name for you ladies, but it isn't used in high society - outside of a kennel.\" At the time, use of the actual word would have been censored by the Hays Office. By 1974, Elton John had a hit single (#4 in the U.S. and #14 in the U.K.) with \"The Bitch Is Back\", in which he says \"bitch\" repeatedly. It was, however, censored by some radio stations. On late night U.S. television, the character Emily Litella (1976-1978) on Saturday Night Live (portrayed by Gilda Radner) would frequently refer to Jane Curtin under her breath at the end of their Weekend Update routine in this way: \"Oh! Never mind...! Bitch!\"\n\nBitchin'  arose in the 1950s to describe something found to be cool or rad.\n\nModern use can include self-description, often as an unfairly difficult person. For example, in the New York Times bestseller The Bitch in the House, a woman describes her marriage: \"I'm fine all day at work, but as soon as I get home, I'm a horror....I'm the bitch in the house.\" Boy George admitted \"I was being a bitch\" in a falling out with Elton John.\n\nGenerally, the term bitch is still considered offensive, and not accepted in formal situations. According to linguist Deborah Tannen, \"Bitch is the most contemptible thing you can say about a woman. Save perhaps the four-letter C word.\" It's common for the word to be censored on Prime time TV, often rendered as \"the b-word\". During the 2008 U.S. presidential campaign, a John McCain supporter referred to Hillary Clinton by asking, \"How do we beat the bitch?\" The event was reported in censored format: On CNN's \"The Situation Room,\" Washington Post media critic and CNN \"Reliable Sources\" host Howard Kurtz observed that \"Senator McCain did not embrace the 'b' word that this woman in the audience used.\" ABC reporter Kate Snow adopted the same locution. On CNN's \"Out in the Open,\" Rick Sanchez characterized the word without using it by saying, \"Last night, we showed you a clip of one of his supporters calling Hillary Clinton the b-word that rhymes with witch.\" A local Fox 25 news reporter made the same move when he rhymed the unspoken word with rich.\n\nA study reported that, when used on social media, bitch \"aims to promote traditional, cultural beliefs about femininity\". Used hundreds of thousands of times per day on such platforms, it is associated with sexist harassment, \"victimizing targets\", and \"shaming\" victims who do not abide by degrading notions about femininity.\n\nReappropriation\n\nIn the context of modern feminism, bitch has varied reappropriated meanings that may connote a strong female (anti-stereotype of weak submissive woman), cunning (equal to males in mental guile), or else it may be used as a tongue-in cheek backhanded compliment for someone who has excelled in an achievement. For example, Bitch magazine describes itself as a \"feminist response to pop culture\".\n\nFeminist attorney Jo Freeman (Joreen) authored \"The BITCH Manifesto\" in 1968: A Bitch takes shit from no one. You may not like her, but you cannot ignore her....[Bitches] have loud voices and often use them. Bitches are not pretty....Bitches seek their identity strictly thru themselves and what they do. They are subjects, not objects...Often they do dominate other people when roles are not available to them which more creatively sublimate their energies and utilize their capabilities. More often they are accused of domineering when doing what would be considered natural by a man. Bitch has also been reappropriated by hip-hop culture, rappers use the adjective \"bad bitch\" to refer to an independent, confident, attractive woman.",

  "Pine View School\n\nPine View School for the Gifted, or simply known as Pine View School, is a public, college-preparatory, coeducational school located in Osprey, Florida. Pine View serves students from 2nd through 12th grades.\n\nHistory\n\nIn 1969, the school was founded as the state's first school for the intellectually gifted. The first director was John D. Woolever, an educator who had written numerous scholarly articles on education throughout his career. During the school's early history, many feared it would be closed, particularly when the school moved to its current campus, designed by Carl Abbott, FAIA, in 1994. In 2007-2008, the Florida State Legislature considered abolishing the Exceptional Student Educational (ESE) label \"gifted.\" On this occasion, Pine View was included in a statewide comprehensive policy assessment completed by the Florida Legislature's Office of Program Policy Analysis & Government Accountability (OPPAGA), which determined that gifted programs were thriving and that the ESE label \"gifted\" had more advantages than disadvantages.\n\nAt the end of the 2012\u20132013 school year, Steve Largo, Pine View's principal of 25 years, retired. Stephen Covert took Largo's place as Pine View principal on July 1, 2013.\n\nIn 2022, the class president's graduation speech went viral on social media and received national attention. After being told by the school principal that he could not mention LGBTQ rights in his speech, the class president instead euphemistically referred to his \"curly hair\" and thanked his classmates for their support.\n\nNation rankings\n\nDuring the 2003\u20132004 school year, Pine View School was recognized with the Blue Ribbon School Award of Excellence by the United States Department of Education, the highest award an American school can receive.\n\nIn 2014 Pine View was ranked the number one school in Florida and the sixth-best school in the Country. In 2013, Pine View was ranked by U.S. News & World Report as the sixth-best public high school in the nation. The previous year, Newsweek ranked Pine View the 15th best public high school in the nation. Out of public and private schools, Pine View was rated the 6th best high school in the nation in 2007, 11th in 2008, 14th in 2009, 30th in 2012, and 6th in 2013 by U.S. News. Due to its average SAT score of 1335 for 2005, the school was listed among Newsweek magazine's 21 Public Elite American high schools. It was the only Public Elite school in Florida. Pine View's U.S. News & World Report 2012 national ranking was called into question when it seemed the ranking was significantly deflated when U.S. News calculated Pine View's 8th grade students as high school students who did not participate in Advanced Placement courses (a significant factor in its methodology) and incorrectly factored Pine View's AP pass rate.\n\nIn 2019 Pine View School was ranked No. 15 in National Rankings, No. 8 in Magnet High Schools and No. 23 in STEM High Schools.\n\nState rankings\n\nIn 2012, the Florida Department of Education ranked Pine View as the best Florida school that combined high school students with other grade levels. The ranking was produced by crunching state and national test data. In the same year, Pine View was ranked by Newsweek as the 4th best high school in Florida. U.S. News & World Report ranked Pine View the best high school in Florida, based on its 2013 national ranking. In 2009, Pine View was rated America's Best High School for Florida by Business Week.\n\nAdmission requirements\n\nAs a full-time gifted program, Pine View maintains selective entrance requirements. Students may be referred for admission by administrators, teachers, staff members, or parents. Prospective students are admitted based on the gifted identification standards that are required by the Florida Department of Education. Since other Sarasota County district schools house gifted programs, an important part of admission is considering if Pine View's program best meets the student's educational needs. At Pine View, students must enroll at the beginning of each school year. Other district gifted programs enroll students during the school year.\n\nCurriculum\n\nPine View's curriculum emphasizes rigor, differentiated instruction, and, in high school, students' academic self-determination. In elementary and middle school, students take classes that are accelerated and go more in-depth than topically similar courses at other schools. Students begin to rotate teachers and classrooms beginning in 4th grade. Starting in 6th grade, students are placed in different levels in math based on a standardized test administered at the end of 5th grade. Students can begin to choose some of their course load beginning in 7th grade and continuing throughout high school.\n\nAt the beginning of high school, students create their own individual four-year academic plans, which they refine and revise as the years progress. This differentiated instruction results in a variety of math, English, science, social science, and foreign language levels being offered to students in the same grade. The substantial elective selection allows students access to breadth and depth of their interests. By the 11th grade, students exercise significant autonomy over their schedules. Students largely build their own curriculum, subject to the approval of their teachers and administrators.\n\nMost high school courses are offered as honors (except where Florida statute prohibits the designations, such as in foreign language classes) and/or Advanced Placement (AP) courses. Students can start taking AP classes, the centerpiece of the Pine View curriculum, beginning in ninth grade. Dual Enrollment (DE) classes are also offered on campus to high school students.",

  "Destruction of Santiago\n\nThe Destruction of Santiago, now the capital of Chile, occurred on September 11th, 1541. It was a confrontation between Spanish conquistadors and a coalition of Mapuche-Picunche tribes.\n\nBackground\n\nThe execution of Solier and his companions, who had started a rebellion, the destroying of the Marga Marga mine, and the burning of the ship at Conc\u00f3n had lowered the spirits of the Spanish conquistadores. Apart from living in fear of an attack or rebellion from the indigenous peoples at any moment, these events had also reduced their numbers. With thirteen dead at Conc\u00f3n and five executed with Solier, the conquistadores were reduced to approximately 130 men, women, and children.\n\nUpon seeing that the Spanish were low in numbers, divided amongst themselves, and not receiving reinforcements, the Mapuche became motivated to unify themselves. All of the natives from Aconcagua, Santiago, and Cachapoal united under the single command of toqui Michimalonco with the intent of attacking the Spaniards and expelling them from their lands.\n\nPedro de Valdivia believed that it would be preferable to disperse the indigenous forces before they could strike. For this reason, he chose 90-100 men and left for the Cachapoal valley at full gallop. Left behind in Santiago were 32 cavalry, 18 men armed with arquebuses, and between 300 and 350 yanakuna under the command of the Lieutenant General, Alonso de Monroy.\n\nThe Mapuche knew of the Spanish\u2019s movements, however, since there were spies among the friendly natives and the yanakuna. When they heard that Valdivia was leaving with his men, they decided that it was the opportune time to get rid of the foreigners.\n\nThe Attack on Santiago\n\nAt 4:00 a.m. on September 11, an army of natives, numbered between 8,000 and 10,000, came out of the forests surrounding Santiago. One of the guards, Santiago de Azoca, sounded the alarm and the defenders immediately took their posts, which had been previously assigned by Monroy and the maestre de campo Francisco de Villagra.\n\nThe Mapuche, protected from the arquebus shots by the palisade, rained down arrows and stones upon the city\u2019s defenders. The Spaniards were able to resist until sunrise, when they were able to neutralize the attack through effective means, but their low numbers made respite impossible. One after another, the conquistadores received wounds from minor to medium severity. Each wounded soldier would withdraw from the front line to be bandaged with a shirt sleeve or rag by In\u00e9s de Suarez, and would then return to his post. The natives, angered by the Spaniard\u2019s relentless resistance, set fire to the nearby hay farms. The defenders couldn\u2019t try to extinguish the flames without abandoning the trenches, and the Mapuche would not have let them, either. They had to withdraw to the plaza, which became the last and only point of resistance. The account is given that Pedro Sancho de la Hoz left his prison dragging his shackles behind him and, waving around a spear, took a place amid the defense. With a warning from Alonso de Monroy, he was allowed to remove his shackles and he fought briefly until the end of the encounter. A clergyman, Father Lobo, also helped in the battle, fighting as \"a wolf amongst sheep\" at the front of a cavalry charge.\n\nThe Plan of In\u00e9s de Suarez\n\nAfter fighting for nearly 12 hours, the Spanish resistance was being defeated. Two men had already died, almost everyone was wounded, and after endless fighting with spears and sabers, the exhaustion was beginning to overwhelm them.\n\nBut In\u00e9s de Suarez, the mistress of Pedro de Valdivia, had an idea that would save the lives of the Spanish conquistadors. Seeing the death of the seven captive caciques as the only hope for salvation, In\u00e9s proposed decapitating them and throwing their heads among the natives in order to cause panic. Many men thought defeat was inevitable and opposed the plan, arguing that keeping the native leaders alive was their only chance for survival. But In\u00e9s insisted in moving forward with her plan and she set off for the house where the leaders were being held. It was protected by Francisco Rubio and Hernando de la Torre, to whom she gave the orders of execution. Witnesses of the event narrate that de la Torre, upon asking in what manner they should kill the prisoners, received as his answer from In\u00e9s, \u201cin this manner.\u201d She then took the sword from the guard and decapitated Quilicanta and subsequently all of the caciques taken as hostages. She then, by her own hand, threw their heads among the attackers.\n\nThis gesture was interpreted by the natives as a warning that if they did not retreat, they would suffer the same fate as their chiefs. Incredibly, they turned around and started the retreat even though they had victory in their hands.\n\nConsequences\n\nAlmost all of the conquistadores were wounded and they lost two men, fifteen horses, and a high number of indigenous aides. But these losses were insignificant when compared to the disaster caused by the fire in the city. Approximately half of the city was burned to the ground.\n\nAlonso de Monroy sent a missive to Pedro de Valdivia, in the which he counted what remained from the fire as \"the precious horses, their arms,...two small pigs, a sucking-pig, a cock and hen, and about two handfuls of wheat.\" Pedro de Valdivia came back to Santiago four days after the assault. Upon receiving the news of the attack, he had marched from Cachapoal with fourteen of his men, leaving the rest behind with Pedro Gomez so that they could continue in the fight against the natives of Cachapoal.\n\nThe Mapuche expected a fierce punishment from Valdivia once he returned, but he, understanding that prolonging the conflict would be the worst option, tried to reach a resolution. The relative peace that followed allowed the Spanish to reconstruct the city, this time with adobe to reduce the consequences of any future fire.",
  "Rambert Dance Company\n\nRambert (known as Rambert Dance Company before 2014) is a leading British dance company. Formed at the start of the 20th century as a classical ballet company, it exerted a great deal of influence on the development of dance in the United Kingdom, and today, as a contemporary dance company, continues to be one of the world's most renowned dance companies. It has previously been known as the Ballet Club, and the Ballet Rambert.\n\nHistory\n\nDame Marie Rambert (1888\u20131982), founder of Rambert Dance Company, was born in Warsaw, Poland where she was inspired to become a dancer after seeing Isadora Duncan perform. She went to Paris and after an early career as a recital artist and teacher she was engaged by Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes as assistant to the choreographer Vaslav Nijinsky on The Rite of Spring. She also taught Dalcroze Eurythmics to the company. During her year with the Ballets Russes her appreciation of classical ballet developed thus combining a love for traditional and new dance forms. During the First World War she settled in England where she met and married the playwright Ashley Dukes. Her association with Diaghilev led her to study ballet with the renowned Italian ballet master Enrico Cecchetti, after which she joined the company as a dancer in the corps de ballet. In 1919 Rambert established a dance school in Notting Hill Gate, London, teaching Checchetti's methods and in 1920, she transitioned into teaching ballet professionally. The school would become the foundation of today's Rambert Dance Company.\n\nIn 1926, Rambert formed a dance troupe using students from her school. Known as the Rambert Dancers, they performed in revues at various London venues. In 1930, the troupe was re-established as the Ballet Club at the Mercury Theatre in London, which was owned by Rambert's husband. The Ballet Club was formed using the finest dance talent that Rambert could find, and was to become the first classical ballet company established in the United Kingdom. The present day Rambert Dance Company is the UK's oldest established dance company. Despite being based at the Mercury Theatre, the company was best known as a touring company, travelling nationwide and soon became known as the Ballet Rambert, the title by which it was most commonly recognised until the current name was adopted in the 1980s.\n\nAs the Ballets Russes had disbanded following the death of Serge Diaghilev in 1929, a number of Rambert's former colleagues joined the Ballet Rambert in its formative years, including Alicia Markova and Anton Dolin, who would later become the first stars of Dame Ninette de Valois' Royal Ballet.\n\nA number of internationally renowned dancers and choreographers made their early appearances with the Ballet Rambert, including Frederick Ashton, Antony Tudor, Agnes de Mille, Andr\u00e9e Howard, Pearl Argyle, Walter Gore and Peggy van Praagh.\n\nDuring the 1970s the Ballet Rambert also presented shows, first on stage and later via BBC television to engage the interest of a younger audience, using the anagrammatic name Bertram Batell's Side Show.\n\nWhilst developing a strong ballet culture in Britain and insisting on solid classical training, Rambert always intended that her company would dictate new trends in dance. The Ballet Rambert was recognised as one of the most innovative ballet companies of the 20th century, producing some of the world's most renowned choreographers. By the middle of the century, the Royal Ballet had superseded the company as the UK's leading classical ballet company, so Rambert made the decision to diversify the work of the company, introducing modern and neoclassical work into the repertoire. In the 1960s, the Ballet Rambert moved completely from classical ballet, concentrating instead on the development of contemporary dance. The company has since developed a worldwide reputation in this field, becoming known as the Rambert Dance Company in 1987. In 2013, Dance Company was dropped from its title, to become simply Rambert.\n\nRambert tours Britain annually, accompanied by its own Rambert Orchestra (formerly the associate orchestra London Musici). It is commonly associated with such theatres as Sadler's Wells the Theatre Royal, Brighton and The Lowry in Salford, Greater Manchester. In November 2013, Rambert moved from Chiswick, London, to new, purpose-built headquarters on London's South Bank. The company was given a plot of land by Coin Street Community Builders, in exchange for delivering an annual dance outreach programme. For the first time in its history, Rambert's new home will allow the public greater access to its extensive archive material in a purpose-built resource centre. Her Majesty The Queen, accompanied by His Royal Highness The Duke of Edinburgh, officially opened Rambert's new home on the South Bank on Friday 21 March 2014.\n\nMembers\n\nNotable members of the Company have included: Frederick Ashton, Antony Tudor, Diana Gould (who married Yehudi Menuhin), Audrey Hepburn, Maude Lloyd, Sally Gilmour, Beryl Goldwyn, Lucette Aldous, Christopher Bruce and Norman Morrice.\n\nArtistic Director\n\nThe artistic director until 2017 was Mark Baldwin (a former dancer with the company), and the executive director is Helen Shute. The search for a new artistic director was finished when as of October 2018 with the appointment of Benoit Swan Pouffer.\n\nIn 2005, the Institute of Physics commissioned the Rambert Dance Company to produce a dance commemorating the centenary of Albert Einstein's groundbreaking scientific ideas of 1905. The piece, choreographed by Mark Baldwin, was called Constant Speed.\n\nIn 2009, the company toured The Comedy of Change with music composed by Julian Anderson and production design by Kader Attia. Choreography was by Mark Baldwin, who said: \"It started with something Stephen Keynes, my friend for about 30 years, came up with. His mother's father was Darwin's son \u2013 he's the great-grandson. He's also nephew of John Maynard Keynes, so the ballerina Lydia Lopokova of course was his auntie. He made the suggestion that we do a piece to commemorate the Darwin year, 2009\"\n\nThe Rambert School\n\nThe Rambert Ballet School that Rambert founded in 1919, has reinvented itself on a number of occasions since, and due to the changes and innovations of the dance company, three separate schools have operated under the name. Two of these schools later merged and the third closed to leave the school which survives today.\n\nThe present day school is based in premises in Twickenham, London, and was formed in 2001 as part of the West London Institute of Higher Education. This was later subsumed into Brunel University and in 2003, the Rambert School became independent again and is now known as the Rambert School of Ballet and Contemporary Dance. It offers a two-year foundation degree, a three-year bachelor's degree, a three-year vocational course, and postgraduate courses to doctoral level. Students go on to achieve positions with dance companies including Dutch National Ballet, Northern Ballet Theatre, Scottish Ballet, Boston Ballet, Netherlands Dance Theatre, Merce Cunningham Dance Company, Richard Alston Dance Company, Rambert Dance Company, Bejart Ballet and Scottish Dance Theatre. The Rambert School is an affiliate of the Conservatoire for Dance and Drama. The current principal and artistic director is Amanda Britton.",

  "Valpolicella\n\nValpolicella is a viticultural zone of the province of Verona, Italy, east of Lake Garda. The hilly agricultural and marble-quarrying region of small holdings north of the Adige is famous for wine production. Valpolicella ranks just after Chianti in total Italian Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC) wine production.\n\nThe red wine known as Valpolicella is typically made from three grape varieties: Corvina Veronese, Rondinella, and Molinara. A variety of wine styles is produced in the area, including a recioto dessert wine and Amarone, a strong wine made from dried grapes. Most basic Valpolicellas are light, fragrant table wines produced in a novello style, similar to Beaujolais nouveau and released only a few weeks after harvest. Valpolicella Classico is made from grapes grown in the original Valpolicella production zone. Valpolicella Superiore is aged at least one year and has an alcohol content of at least 12 percent. Valpolicella Ripasso is a form of Valpolicella Superiore made with partially dried grape skins that have been left over from fermentation of Amarone or recioto.\n\nWinemaking in the region has existed since at least the time of the ancient Greeks. The name \"Valpolicella\" appeared in charters of the mid-12th century, combining two valleys previously thought of independently. Its etymology is likely from the Latin vallis pulicellae (\"valley of river deposits\"). Today Valpolicella's economy is heavily based on wine production. The region, colloquially called the \"pearl of Verona\", has also been a preferred location for rural vacation villas. Seven comuni compose Valpolicella: Pescantina, San Pietro in Cariano, Negrar, Marano di Valpolicella, Fumane, Sant\u2019Ambrogio di Valpolicella and Sant\u2019Anna d\u2019Alfaedo. The Valpolicella production zone was enlarged to include regions of the surrounding plains when Valpolicella achieved DOC status in 1968. In December 2009, the production of Amarone and recioto dessert wines within the Valpolicella DOC received their own separate Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) status.\n\nHistory\n\nViticulture has been used in the Veneto region since at least the time of the ancient Greeks, though the exact period of cultivation for the Valpolicella area is not precisely known. The tradition of using partially dried-grapes (seen today in the modern Valpolicella wines of Amarone) was known as the \"Greco\" or \"Greek style\" of winemaking, with its origins likely dating back to this period. In the 6th century AD, the Roman writer Cassiodorus notes that the sweet wines of the area were favorites in the courts of the Ostrogothic Kingdom of Italy. Since the 8th century AD, the Republic of Venice was long a vital trading port in the Mediterranean, linking the Byzantine Empire with the rest of Europe. Merchants records shows that one of the items regularly traded through Venice was local wines produced in Verona province in the hills west of Venice. During the 15th and 16th century, struggles with the Ottoman Turks led to frequent blockades of the Venetian ports, limiting the amount of available export wines from the Greek isles and abroad. This further stimulated the development of domestic vineyards for the Venetians, who pushed even further into the hills of the Verona and the Valpolicella region.\n\nThe 19th century brought a series of calamities to most wine producing regions of Italy-including the phylloxera epidemic, oidium, downy mildew and the political upheaval of the Risorgimento. According to the 1889 writings of the French wine historian Dr. C. B. Cerletti, one of the few Italian wine regions to emerge from this period relatively unscathed was Valpolicella. In the 1950s, the \"Amarone\" style of winemaking was rediscovered. In 1968, the Valpolicella region received official recognition for quality wine production when it was granted its own DOC. However, with DOC recognition also came a large expansion of vineyard areas that were permitted to produce Valpolicella DOC wine, including land in the fertile plains of the Po River, which tend to produce excessively large yields of grapes with varying qualities. Additionally the grape composition for Valpolicella wines were expanded to include varieties of lower potential quality such as Molinara and Rondinella. This led to a general drop in quality, which had a detrimental impact on not only the area's reputation on the international wine market but also on sales and prices. As winemaking became less profitable, the vineyards in the most labor-intensive areas (such as the hillsides in the classico zone) were uprooted and abandoned. This shifted the source of grape production even further away from the better quality producing hillside regions down to the fertile plains.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the Amarone wines of Valpolicella experienced a spike in popularity on the world's wine market. Production of Amarone jumped from 522,320 US gallons (19,772 hectoliters) in 1972 to 1.2 million gallons (46,500 hl) by 1990. By 2000 Amarone production grew to over 3.9 million gallons (148,000 hl). By this point, the price for grapes destined for Amarone production was nearly three times higher than what a comparable quantity of grapes would fetch for basic Valpolicella production. This sparked renewed interest in planting vineyards in the high altitude hillside locations that produced lower yields of grapes better suited for Amarone production. In the 21st century, the reputation of Valpolicella wines continued to expand on the world's wine market, as ambitious winemakers began to invest more in advanced viticultural and winemaking techniques that produce higher quality wines. In 2003, the DOC regulations were adjusted to eliminate mandatory blending requirements for sub-quality grapes such as Molinara. At the end of 2009, the production of both Amarone and recioto dessert wines in the Valpolicella zone received Italy's highest quality wine designation as a DOCG zones.\n\nClimate and geography\n\nThe Valpolicella region has mostly a mild to cool continental climate that is influenced by its proximity to two sizable bodies of water-Lake Garda to the west and the Adriatic Sea to the southeast. The coolest regions are in the Monti Lessini foothills to the north, where cool winds blow southward from the Alps. This area is traditionally classified as the classico zone. Towards the south and east, the climate gets warmer in the fertile plains of the Adige river. The mean temperature in the growing season is usually around 74.5 \u00b0F (23.6 \u00b0C), with average rainfall around 34 inches (860 mm).\n\nThe vineyard soils of the region range from morainic gravel near Lake Garda to more dolomite residual gravel with alluvial deposits in the fertile central plains. Towards the east and near the Soave DOC are several areas featuring volcanic soils. The most favorably situated vineyards are located in the Monti Lessini foothills in the classico zone where the grapes ripen at altitudes between 490 to(-).\n\nWine regions\n\nThe Valpolicella zone is bordered to the west by the Bardolino DOC, located along the banks of Lake Garda, which produces similar wines to basic Valpolicella using many of the same grapes. The historical \"heart\" of Valpolicella winemaking is in the Monti Lessini hills located northwest of the town of Verona. In 1968, the boundaries of the region were extended far eastward towards the DOC production zone of Soave and south to the plains of the northern bank of the Po river and its tributary the Adige.\n\nToday the original zone is known as Valpolicella Classico zone and may duly noted on the wine labels of wines produced completely from grapes grown in this area. Today over 40% of all wine production in Valpolicella takes place in the classico zone, with an estimated yearly production of 12.2 million gallons (460,000 hl). Another sub-zone that is permitted to attach its name to the wine is the Valpolicella Valpantena located in the valley located just east of Verona.\n\nGrapes and wine styles\n\nMost of the wines produced under the Valpolicella DOC are red and usually contain a sizable amount of the area's most distinguished grape, Corvina. Other grapes used in the production of Valpolicella wine most often include Rondinella and Corvinone, but also Molinara, Rossignola, Negrara, Barbera, Sangiovese and Bigolona. A few producers are experimenting with reviving the indigenous grape Oseleta in Valpolicella. The wines are produced in a wide variety of styles ranging from basic nouveau table wines, full-bodied red wines, sweet dessert wines and even sparkling spumante. The most basic Valpolicella are light-bodied and often served slightly chilled. They have many characteristics similar to a Beaujolais wine and are often noted for their sour cherry flavor. While full-bodied recioto and Amarone styles reach alcohol levels of 15\u201316%, most Valpolicellas have more moderate alcohol levels around 11",

Portfolio management is about strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in the choice of debt vs. equity, domestic vs. international, growth vs. safety, and other trade-offs encountered in the attempt to maximize return at a given appetite for risk.\n\nPortfolio managers are presented with investment ideas by internal buy-side analysts and sell-side analysts from investment banks. It is their job to sift through the relevant information and use their judgment to buy and sell securities. Throughout the day they read reports, talk to company managers, and monitor industry and economic trends, looking for the right company and time to invest the portfolio's capital.\n\nA team of analysts and researchers are ultimately responsible for establishing an investment strategy, selecting appropriate investments, and allocating each investment properly for a fund or asset management vehicle.\n\nIn the case of mutual and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), there are two forms of portfolio management: passive and active. Passive management simply tracks a market index, commonly referred to as indexing or index investing. Active management involves a single manager, co-managers, or a team of managers who attempt to beat the market return by actively managing a fund's portfolio through investment decisions based on research and decisions on individual holdings. Closed-end funds are generally actively managed.\n\nInsider trading\n\nA portfolio manager risks losing his past compensation if he engages in insider trading; in fact, lawyers at the law firm Davis & Gilbert wrote in an article in a 2014 article in Financial Fraud Law Report that: \"'Based upon courts current application of New York's faithless servant doctrine, it is virtually certain that if... hedge fund... managers engage in wrongdoing... those.. managers will be forced to disgorge all compensation received during the period the wrongdoing occurred'.\"\n\nIn Morgan Stanley v. Skowron, 989 F. Supp. 2d 356 (S.D.N.Y. 2013), applying New York's faithless servant doctrine, the court held that a hedge fund's PM engaging in insider trading in violation of his company's code of conduct, which also required him to report his misconduct, must repay his employer the full $31 million his employer paid him as compensation during his period of faithlessness. The court called the insider trading the \"ultimate abuse of a PM's position.\" The judge also wrote: \"\"In addition to exposing Morgan Stanley to government investigations and direct financial losses, Skowron's behavior damaged the firm's reputation, a valuable corporate asset.\"\n\nSystems\n\nThe IT infrastructure for a PM facilitates the delivery of updated prices and market information to allow for trade orders, trade executions, and their overall portfolio value. The IT infrastructure, known as a portfolio management system (PMS), include components such as an order management system, execution management system, portfolio valuation, risk, and compliance. A front-back PMS will also include a middle office and back office components such as trade management, pre/post-trade tools, cash management, and net asset value calculations.",
  "2005 RH52\n\n is an extreme trans-Neptunian object from the extended scattered disc in the outermost region of the Solar System, approximately 130 km in diameter. It was first observed on 3 September 2005, by astronomers with the Canada\u2013France Ecliptic Plane Survey using the Canada\u2013France\u2013Hawaii Telescope at the Mauna Kea Observatories in Hawaii, United States.\n\nThe detached, extended scattered disc object (ESDO) is on a highly eccentric orbit and belongs to the extreme trans-Neptunian objects.\n\nOrbit and classification\n\n belongs to a small group of detached objects with perihelion distances of 30 AU or more, and semi-major axes of 150 AU or more. Such extreme trans-Neptunian objects (ETNOs) can not reach such orbits without some perturbing object, which lead to the speculation of Planet Nine.\n\nIt orbits the Sun at a distance of 39\u2013270 AU once every 1923 years and 10 months (702,689 days; semi-major axis of 154.68 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.75 and an inclination of 20\u00b0 with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with its first official observation at Mauna Kea in September 2005.\n\nNumbering and naming\n\nAs of 2018, this minor planet has neither been numbered nor named by the Minor Planet Center. The official discoverer(s) will be defined when the object is numbered.\n\nPhysical characteristics\n\nAccording to the Johnston's archive and to American astronomer Michael Brown,  measures 128 and 130 kilometers in diameter based on an assumed albedo of 0.09 and 0.08, respectively. Due to its small size, it is listed as \"probably not\" a dwarf planet (100\u2013200 km) on Michael Brown's website, which uses a 5-class taxonomic system that ranges from \"nearly certainly\" to \"possibly\" for potential dwarf planet candidates. As of 2018, no rotational lightcurve has been obtained from photometric observations. The body's rotation period, pole and shape remain unknown.",

  "The Wrecker (1929 film)\n\nThe Wrecker (Der W\u00fcrger) is a 1929 British-German silent crime film directed by G\u00e9za von Bolv\u00e1ry and starring Carlyle Blackwell, Joseph Striker, and Benita Hume. The film was based on the play of the same title by Arnold Ridley. It was produced by Michael Balcon for Gainsborough Pictures in a co-production with the German firm Felsom Film.\n\nPlot\n\nA criminal referred to by the press as \"The Wrecker\" is orchestrating accidents on Britain's railways. One such accident occurs on the (fictional) United Coast Lines Railway, whose train is carrying Roger Doyle (Joseph Striker), who has retired from cricket to work on the railway. Roger survives, and reports the accident to his uncle, Sir Gerald Bartlett (Winter Hall), the managing director of the railway, and his assistant, the sly Ambrose Barney (Carlyle Blackwell). Unbeknownst to them, Ambrose is The Wrecker, and is also the head of the Kyle Motor-Coach Company, whose buses are introduced on services where The Wrecker has struck, hoping to frighten passengers off of the trains and onto buses. When Sir Gerald becomes suspicious of Ambrose following yet another accident, he is shot dead.\n\nAfter receiving a tip-off from one of Ambrose's employees, Roger and bumbling detective Ramesses Ratchett (Leonard Thompson) foil another planned accident, much to the delight of the press. Ambrose, enraged at being foiled, plans another accident, but his conversation is recorded onto a wax cylinder by Roger and his girlfriend, Mary Shelton (Benita Hume), Sir Gerald's secretary who had been on the train that Roger had saved from disaster. On hearing the wax cylinder that exposes his crimes, Ambrose shoots the phonograph, destroying the cylinder, and flees from Roger and Mary, only to find himself on the very train that is to be wrecked. Ambrose holds Roger at gunpoint, but is attacked from behind by Mary and subdued, and the train is brought to a safe halt. With Ambrose defeated, Roger and Mary profess their love for each other, disappearing in a cloud of steam as the train reverses away.\n\nProduction\n\nThe film was shot as a silent, with a soundtrack was later added. The crash scene was filmed at Herriard on the Basingstoke and Alton Light Railway. A set of SECR coaches and a SECR F1 Class locomotive No. A148 were released on an incline to collide into a Foden steam lorry. The impact, which destroyed the locomotive and the lorry, was recorded by 22 cameras and has been described as \"the most spectacular rail crash in cinema history.\"\n\nRestoration\n\nThe film has been restored, with a new musical score by the composer Neil Brand. On 26 November 2009 it was launched at a special screening at the Watercress Line, a heritage railway close to where the filming took place.

  "Rai Bagan\n\nSavitribai Deshmukh (died c. 1680-1690), better known by her title Rai Bagan or Raibagan (\u0930\u093e\u092f\u092c\u093e\u0917\u0928, lit. \"Royal Tigress\"), was a female Mughal general under the Emperor Aurangzeb. She was the widow of the Mughal sardar Raje Udaram Deshmukh of Mahur jagir in Deccan. After her son's death in Battle of Samugarh, she led her forces aiding the then prince Aurangzeb in the battle, which paved his way to become the emperor. The emperor conferred upon her the royal title. She aided Aurangzeb's uncle Shaista Khan in the Mughal campaign against the Maratha empire's founder Shivaji.\n\nBattle of Samugarh\n\nIn 1658, prince Aurangzeb rebelled against his father Shah Jahan, when he heard about his illness. It was the war of accession in which Aurangzeb fought with his brother Dara Shikoh. The Mughal Empire split into two factions, one with Aurangzeb and another with Dara. They fought the final Battle of Samugarh near Agra. Jagjivanrao, son of the late Mughal Sardar Raje Udaram and Savitribai, fought alongside Aurangzeb. He died at Samugarh. When his troops were left leaderless, Savitribai led his troops, however her identity remained hidden from the prince. Aurangzeb saw her fighting. He was so impressed because she was the only female warrior in the Mughal Army.\n\nWhen Aurangzeb crowned himself, he ordered Savitribai to be presented before him. She appeared before him in his court. He inquired about her and discovered her identity as the mother of the fallen troop leader Jagjivanrao. Even when her only son died in front of her eyes, she led the troops and fought valiantly. Aurangzeb was so impressed that he gave her the title of Raibagan, \"Royal Tigress\".\n\nConfrontation with Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj\n\nIn 1661, when Shaista Khan was appointed governor of Deccan by Aurangzeb, he captured Pune and nearby main stations while Shivaji was stuck in the siege of Panhala Fort by the Bijapur sultanate. When Shivaji escaped the siege and finally managed to reach his base Rajgad Fort, he turned his focus on Shahista Khan. Shivaji made truces with Shahista Khan and also with Ali Adil Shah II of Bijapur. Raibagan was told to assist Shahista Khan. Meanwhile, Shahista Khan appointed Kartalab Khan and Raibagan to attack Konkan, which was under Shivaji control. Khan gave around 20,000 forces to both of them. They chose the path of Kurvanda Ghat. Shivaji and his army were waiting for them in the forest near Umberkhind (Umber Gorge). In the Battle of Umberkhind, around 300-400 Maratha archers and swordsmen led by Shivaji defeated the Mughals. Raibagan, after seeing his bravery and fighting skills, started to praise Shivaji. She praised him even in the court of Shahista Khan and criticized Shahista Khan fearlessly. Since she had saved the whole army of Mughals, Aurangzeb praised Raibagan for her presence of mind.\n\nIn April 1663, Shivaji made a surgical strike on Lal Mahal where Shahista Khan was camping in Pune. Khan escaped with heavy losses. Later, he was sent to Bengal on the orders of Aurangzeb. Raibagan was ordered to patrol in the Pune area.\n\nAccording to Sabhasad Bakhar, Raibagan again confronted Shivaji during the Battle of Surat in January 1664. She lost her fight and was captured. Shivaji showed hospitality towards her, honoured her and sent her back. She was then sent back to her jagir. She retired from military service. She died around 1680-1690.",
  "Walter Schultz (Gauleiter)\n\nWalter Schultz (27 November 1874 \u2013 8 August 1953) was an official of the Nazi Party who served as the Party Gauleiter in Hesse-Nassau, as well as in several governmental posts.\n\nEarly life\n\nSchultz was born the son of a farmer in Lautenburg in West Prussia, which today is Lidzbark in Poland. He went to the gymnasium and graduated in 1894. He then entered military service as a fahnenjunker (officer cadet) in the Baden Pioneer Battalion No. 14, headquartered in Kehl. He attended military school in Anklam and was commissioned a Leutnant in April 1896. He was then assigned to Pioneer Battalion No. 19 based in Strasbourg. On 18 November 1897, he transferred to the reserves and then returned to school. He studied mathematics and natural sciences at Leipzig University and the University of Marburg, receiving a Ph. D. in December 1902. He then passed the state teacher's examination and began teaching at the secondary level in a realschule in Kassel. In October 1904, he was appointed a head teacher. Around this time, he began to be active in the V\u00f6lkisch movement.\n\nSchultz returned to active military service as an Oberleutnant in World War I. He served from 1914 to 1918, was wounded in action and received the Iron Cross, 1st and 2nd class. At the end of the war, he left the service with the rank of Hauptmann in the reserves. He resumed his teaching career at a gymnasium in Kassel. By 1924 he was a member of the V\u00f6lkisch-Social Bloc, a right-wing political alliance. He then joined the National Socialist Freedom Movement, a front organization set up when the Nazi Party was outlawed in the wake of the Beer Hall Putsch.\n\nNazi Party career\n\nIn April 1925, after the ban on the Nazi Party had been lifted, Schultz organized the Party in the Prussian Province of Hesse-Nassau and was made Gauleiter with his capital in Kassel. On 22 May 1925 he was formally enrolled in the Party (membership number 5,767). At the end of the year, the large Gau was divided into two parts. Schultz retained the leadership of Gau Hesse-Nassau North, while Gau Hesse-Nassau South went to Anton Haselmayer, based in Frankfurt. However, when Haselmayer resigned for health reasons on 22 September 1926, Schultz temporarily became Acting Gauleiter in Hesse-Nassau South. This was very short-lived, as a new permanent replacement, Karl Linder, was appointed on 1 October. Almost a year later, on 1 September 1927, Schultz relinquished active leadership of Gau Hesse-Nassau North and was placed on leave due to the demands of his academic work. He formally stepped down on 1 February 1928 and was succeeded by his Deputy Gauleiter, Karl Weinrich.\n\nIn April 1929 Schultz was promoted to Oberstudienrat (Senior Teacher). Over the next few years, he was twice prosecuted for Nazi political activity. From November 1929 to March 1933, he was the Municipal Delegate to the Landkreis Kassel. In March 1933, he was elected as a deputy to the Kreistag (District Council) of Landkreis Kassel, and was named First District Deputy. From October 1934 until April 1937 he sat on the Provinzialrat (Provincial Council) for the Province of Hesse-Nassau. In addition, Schultz served in an executive capacity as the Landrat (District Administrator) in Landkreis Kassel from July 1934 to April 1937, and in Landkreis Eschwege from April 1937 to May 1945.\n\nIn addition to his government posts, Schultz remained active in the Party organization, becoming the leader of the Municipal Politics Office in Gau Kurhessen in 1933; additionally, from 1938 he worked in the Main Office for Municipal Political Affairs in the Party's Reichsleitung (National Leadership). He served in both these posts until the end of the Nazi regime in May 1945.",

  "Cloud Dance\n\nCloud Dance is the debut album by American sitarist and composer Collin Walcott, released in 1975 on the ECM label. For this record Walcott was joined by the group Gateway consisting of John Abercrombie, Dave Holland and Jack DeJohnette. It was recorded in March 1975, as was the group's debut Gateway. Abercrombie had worked with Walcott the previous year on David Liebman's Drum Ode (ECM 1046), and they collaborated again on Walcott's 1977 album Grazing Dreams.\n\nReception\n\nThe AllMusic review awarded the album 4\u00bd stars.\n\nThe authors of the Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings awarded the album 4 stars, praising its \"freshness and originality,\" and stating: \"'Prancing', for just tablas and double bass, is one of the most exciting performances in the ECM catalogue and convincing evidence of Walcott's desire to extend the idiom of the Garrison/Jones rhythm section... the album as a whole can quite reasonably be heard as a suite of related pieces that dance towards their thematic source in the closing title-piece.\"\n\nWriting for Vinyl Vault, Geoff Anderson commented: \"The musicians were all top-flight and leaders in their own right. They came together and mixed the eastern and western sounds to create something like acoustic jazz-fusion with an Indian twist. Abercrombie's ethereal electric guitar, floating above and around Walcott's sitar is particularly effective in creating a dreamy, cloud-like ambience on several tunes. On the cut 'Prancing,' Walcott on tabla and Holland on bass put the 'dance' in 'Cloud Dance' with a particularly energetic and, yes, danceable performance.\"\n\nIn an article at ECM Reviews, Tyran Grillo called the recording \"one of [Walcott's] most powerful albums ever to grace ECM's vinyl... grooves\", and wrote: \"The telephone wires on the cover are like the strings of some large instrument, with the sky as its sound box. Its clouds don't so much dance as perform, caressing endless waves of voices careening through the ether. The joy of Cloud Dance is that it makes those voices intelligible. Fans of Oregon, of which Walcott was of course an integral part, need look no further for likeminded contemplation.\"",

  "The Power of the Powerless\n\nThe Power of the Powerless (Moc bezmocn\u00fdch) is an expansive political essay written in October 1978 by the Czech dramatist, political dissident, and later statesman, V\u00e1clav Havel.\n\nThe essay dissects the nature of communist regimes of the time, life within such a regime, and how by their very nature such regimes can create dissidents of ordinary citizens. The essay goes on to discuss ideas and possible actions by loose communities of individuals linked by a common cause, such as human-rights petition Charter 77.\n\nOfficially suppressed, the essay was circulated in samizdat form and translated into multiple languages. It became a manifesto for dissent in Czechoslovakia, Poland, and other communist regimes.\n\nThe essay was translated into English by Paul Wilson and published in 1985 as part of a volume of essays edited by John Keane, called The Power of the Powerless: Citizens Against the State in Central-Eastern Europe.\n\nBackground and history\n\nUnder the communist regime in Czechoslovakia, there was an omnipresent pressure exerted by the political apparatus on culture. Various methods were utilized to pressure citizens into compliance. Havel's philosophical mentor, Jan Pato\u010dka, who was also the co-spokesman of the human-rights petition, Charter 77, died of a stroke in March 1977, after an 11-hour interrogation by the Czechoslovak secret police regarding his involvement in the Charter.\n\nHavel wrote \"The Power of the Powerless\" in October 1978, originally meant to be the basis of a planned book of Polish and Czechoslovak essays on the nature of freedom. Each of the contributors of this book was to have received a copy of Havel's essay and then to respond to it.\n\nAfter the launch of Charter 77, which coincided with the release of The Power of the Powerless, Havel was put under continuous pressure by the secret police; he was under constant government surveillance and they interrogated him almost daily. When he did not cave, Havel was imprisoned. He was arrested in May 1979\u2014along with other members of the Committee for the Defense of the Unjustly Prosecuted (V\u00fdbor na obranu nespravedliv\u011b st\u00edhan\u00fdch, or VONS), an organization that Havel co-founded that year\u2014and remained imprisoned until February 1983.\n\nFollowing Havel's arrest, the individual Czechoslovak essays were decided to be 'published' separately and were distributed in samizdat form in 1979; as such, they were the only contributions to be released.\n\nThe essay was translated into English by Paul Wilson and published in 1985 as part of a volume of essays edited by John Keane, called The Power of the Powerless: Citizens Against the State in Central-Eastern Europe, which includes an introduction by Steven Lukes and contributions from various Soviet-era Eastern-European dissidents and intellectuals.\n\nContent\n\nThe topic of how best to resist a totalitarian system occupied Havel's mind after the launch of Charter 77. This became the crux of his essay, which was one of the most \"original and compelling pieces of political writing\" to come out of the Eastern Bloc, according to Havel biographer, John Keane. Dedicated to the memory of Jan Pato\u010dka, the opening section of the essay sought to explain what Charter 77 signified to those living within Czechoslovakia, and \"to give courage\" to fellow opponents of the Soviet bloc elsewhere.\n\nLife in a \"post-totalitarian\" system\n\nHavel coined the term \"post-totalitarian\" for this essay, writing, \"I do not wish to imply by the prefix 'post-' that the system is no longer totalitarian; on the contrary, I mean that it is totalitarian in a way fundamentally different from classical dictatorships...\"\n\nHavel biographer, John Keane, describes Havel's definition of a post-totalitarian world:\"Within the system, every individual is trapped within a dense network of the state's governing instruments\u2026themselves legitimated by a flexible but comprehensive ideology, a'secularized religion'\u2026it is therefore necessary to see, argued Havel, that power relations\u2026are best described as a labyrinth of influence, repression, fear and self-censorship which swallows up everyone within it, at the very least by rendering them silent, stultified and marked by some undesirable prejudices of the powerful\u2026\"\n\nHavel's greengrocer\n\nHavel uses the example of a greengrocer who displays in his shop the sign Workers of the world, unite! Since failure to display the sign could be seen as disloyalty, he displays it and the sign becomes not a symbol of his enthusiasm for the regime, but a symbol of both his submission to it and humiliation by it. Havel returns repeatedly to this motif to show the contradictions between the \"intentions of life\" and the \"intentions of systems\", i.e. between the individual and the state, in a totalitarian society.\n\nAn individual living within such a system must live a lie, to hide that which he truly believes and desires, and to do that which he must do to be left in peace and to survive. This is comparable to the classical tale of \"The Emperor's New Clothes.\" \"[T]hey must live within a lie. They need not accept the lie. It is enough for them to have accepted their life with it and in it. For by this very fact, individuals confirm the system, fulfill the system, make the system, are the system.\"\n\nIndividuals at each level within the bureaucracy must display their own equivalent of the grocer's Workers of the world, unite! sign, oppressing those below them and in turn oppressed by those above. Against this public lie is contrasted a life lived in truth, a title suggested by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and his essay \"Live Not By Lies\". Havel argued that the restoration of a free society could only be achieved through a paradigm based on the individual, \"human existence,\" and a fundamental reconstitution of one's \"respect for self, for others and for the universe;\" to refuse to give power to empty slogans and meaningless rituals, to refuse to allow the lie to oppress oneself, and to refuse to be part of the lie that oppresses others. By doing so individuals illuminate their surroundings revealing to others that they have power.\n\nOvercoming powerlessness\n\nHavel proposes that the oppressed always contain \"within themselves the power to remedy their own powerlessness\u2026\" Havel argued that by an individual \"living in truth\" in their daily life they automatically differentiate themselves from the officially mandated culture prescribed by the State; since power is only effective inasmuch as citizens are willing to submit to it.\n\nHavel explained step-by-step that the powerlessness of the powerful is traceable to several factors: Those who rule at the top of the pyramid are fundamentally incapable of controlling every aspect of an individual citizen's life despite their best efforts to do so. And those in petty power positions all the way down the line perform the prescribed rituals mandated by the State yet it is this blind obedience which in turn tends to dull the perceptions of the leaders at the top\u2014inadvertently opening space for those who wish not to conform.\n\nOfficial power is further eroded by the ideological rituals that the entire power structure depend on, and \"that are ever less credible, exactly because they are untested by public discussion and controversy.\" Havel argued that the part of a human being that yearns for freedom, truth, and self-dignity can never be fully repressed.\n\nHavel echoed Pato\u010dka's sentiment that no matter what the situation, individuals carry responsibility with them. Therefore it is possible to not allow oneself to be humiliated by superiors anymore, or intimidated by the secret police. Havel argued that this oppression can never be universal even if a single person doesn't give it power over themself. Havel felt that all that is suffered over time under such systems often leads to deeper reflection: \"There are times, when we must sink to the bottom of our misery to understand truth, just as we must descend to the bottom of a well to see the stars in broad daylight.\" Havel wrote that \"living in truth\" means rejecting the notion that power is something to be grasped or abolished. Havel instead argues that power is relational.\n\nHavel said the written laws in the East and West are pretty similar. The difference is in their administration. \"Demanding that the laws be upheld\u2026threatens the whole mendacious structure at its point of maximum mendacity.\" People were \"easily and inconspicuously locked up for copying banned books.\" However, \"policemen, prosecutors, or judges\u2026exposed to public attention\u2026suddenly and anxiously begin to take particular care that no cracks appear in the [legal] ritual.\"\n\nForms of opposition to the regime\n\nIn later sections, Havel writes of what form opposition in such regimes could take and the nature of being a dissident in the circumstances of the time, using the example of Charter 77. Havel's political program being a breaking with both the traditional forms of governing and opposition. He contrasts Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk's observation of the limits of grassroots organization, of so-called small works, with the example of the Polish Workers' Defence Committee (Komitet Obrony Robotnik\u00f3w, or KOR) and of what could be achieved through an independent social life and organization to achieve \"social self-defense\". Such a defense throughout the then Eastern Bloc having as its basis the defense of human and civil rights.\n\nHavel touches upon the concepts articulated by fellow dissident and",
  "Jessica M. Feldmark\n\nJessica Marie Page Feldmark (born August 1, 1974) is a Democratic member of the Maryland House of Delegates.\n\nEarly life and career\n\nFeldmark was born on August 1, 1974. She attended Goucher College, where she earned a B.A. degree in sociology and international relations, and American University, where she earned a M.S. degree in organization development. She moved to Columbia, Maryland in 1998 and was elected to the Wilde Lake Village Board in 2000. She resigned from the board in November 2002 to become a special assistant to Howard County councilman-elect Kenneth Ulman. Feldmark followed Ulman into the executive's office following his election in 2006, first serving as a senior advisor until 2009, when she became Ulman's Chief of Staff.\n\nFollowing the election of Howard County executive Allan Kittleman in 2014, Feldmark was let go from her position to make room for Kittleman chief of staff Diane Wilson. A few hours after her departure, the Howard County Council announced that Feldmark would serve as the council's administrator, replacing Sheila Tolliver.\n\nIn February 2018, Feldmark filed to run for Maryland House of Delegates. She came in third place in the Democratic primary election, receiving 21.4 percent of the vote. Feldmark came in second place in the general election, receiving 21.9 percent of the vote.\n\nIn the legislature\n\nFeldmark was sworn into the Maryland House of Delegates on January 9, 2019. She has filed to run for re-election in the 2022 Maryland House of Delegates elections.\n\nIn January 2020, Feldmark filed to run as a convention delegate for Elizabeth Warren at the 2020 Democratic National Convention.\n\nElections\n\nFeldmark introduced legislation during the 2020 legislative session that would expand Maryland's public financing program to candidates other than the governor in statewide elections.\n\nFeldmark introduced legislation during the 2021 legislative session that would introduce universal ballot marking devices and prevent ballots cast by voters with disabilities from being set apart from ballots cast by voters without disabilities. She also introduced legislation that would codify a temporary policy adopted by the Maryland State Board of Elections during the COVID-19 pandemic that would require local election boards to accept an absentee ballot and reject a provisional ballot if they received both from the same voter.\n\nGovernment shutdown\n\nFeldmark introduced legislation during the 2019 legislative session that would provide essential government employees to receive temporary assistance through the state during future government shutdowns. The bill passed and was signed into law by Governor Larry Hogan on March 26, 2019.\n\nSocial issues\n\nIn July 2020, Feldmark and 12 other state legislators signed onto a letter urging the Baltimore County Board of Education to ban the display of hate symbols, including the Confederate flag and swastikas, in schools across Baltimore County unless it is necessary for educational programming.\n\nTaxes\n\nFeldmark introduced legislation in the 2021 legislative session that would alter the state's Job Creation Tax Credit program by requiring that new positions that qualify for the credit pay a local prevailing wage of 150 percent of the state's minimum wage and provide career advancement opportunities, paid leave, and collective bargaining rights. The bill passed but was vetoed by Governor Hogan on May 28, 2021; the legislature voted to override Hogan's veto on the bill during its 2021 legislative session.",
  "Tim Gaines\n\nTim Gaines (born Timothy Hagelganz; December 15, 1962) is an American bass guitarist best-known as the long-time bassist for the Christian metal band Stryper until his departure in 2017.\n\nEarly life\n\nGaines was born in Portland, Oregon, into a German family, whose ancestry was that of the Volga Germans. When Gaines was four years old, he and his family moved to Arcadia, California, where he later attended Arcadia High School. When he was young, he was bullied by classmates at school because of his unique and often mispronounced last name, Hagelganz, and for being the son of Arcadia Presbyterian Church's pastor. He later adopted the stage name Gaines in the likeness of his uncles Reuben, a radio announcer, and Ronnie, a jazz nightclub performer, who also used the name professionally.\n\nWith Stormer\n\nAfter Arcadia High School, Gaines joined the band Stormer, with whom he recorded a demo and had performed extensively in Los Angeles and on Hollywood's Sunset Strip.\n\nAt the time Gaines joined Stormer, they had already been a popular band for 10 years in the Los Angeles area. The lineup at the time consisted of Tom Hardy on vocals; Steve Hall on drums; Stephan Shawn on guitar, keys, and vocals; and Donny Simmons on lead guitar and vocals.\n\nIn an interview about Stormer, Gaines recalled, \"We signed a deal with an indie label called Rockwoodz music out of Phoenix, Arizona, and they put us in the studio to record an album and a Christmas single. Well, the single was the only thing that ever made it to vinyl and 500 singles were sent out all over the U.S. to radio. We got some good reviews for the single in some trade magazines but nothing ever happened with the band. For whatever reason, Rockwoodz went belly up and the album was never released. We did some small tours around the southwest but eventually I was to leave the group.\"\n\nIn 2008, when asked if the demos will be remastered and made public, Gaines replied, \"I doubt if anyone can find the Masters. We are talking of having a Stormer reunion in the near future. We may decide to record it.\" Gaines occasionally collaborated with Donny Simmons and Tom Hardy when he was not working with Stryper.\n\nWith Stryper\n\nBeing a Sunset Strip regular, in 1983, Gaines joined up with Michael Sweet, Robert Sweet, and Oz Fox, all of whom had already formed Roxx Regime, which they would later change to Stryper. Gaines quickly rounded out the quartet's sound with his bass, background vocal, and keyboard skills. Gaines recorded the band's debut EP The Yellow and Black Attack and their follow-up full-length album, Soldiers Under Command, in 1985.\n\nGaines briefly left the band during the pre-production period of the band's Platinum-selling album To Hell with the Devil but rejoined the band after the sessions were concluded to tour. Gaines did not play on the band's follow up, In God We Trust, but toured in support of the album.\n\nGaines's contributions to the band's next release, Against the Law, were evident in his playing throughout the album, but he did not play on the band's cover of Earth, Wind & Fire's \"Shining Star,\" which featured bassist Randy Jackson.\n\nWith Stryper, Gaines has contributed to 17 albums, including live performances and studio albums. Soldiers Under Command was certified Gold and To Hell with the Devil was certified Platinum.\n\nPost-Stryper\n\nAfter Stryper, Gaines played in Rex Carroll's project King James along with Stryper alum Robert Sweet. He also recorded with Tourniquet on Crawl to China. Afterward, he formed SinDizzy with Stryper guitarist Oz Fox and released one album, He's Not Dead.\n\nStryper reunion\n\nGaines's involvement with Fox in SinDizzy led to a partial Stryper reunion in 1999 at a concert in Puerto Rico, to which both SinDizzy and former Stryper frontman Michael Sweet were invited. Later, all former bandmates played a show in Costa Rica, leading to a full-blown reunion in 2000. These appearances led to a 2003 reunion tour and a new compilation release, 7. Gaines spent April and May 2007 supporting Richard Marx on bass, touring the U.S., the Dominican Republic, and Trinidad. Gaines joined Tourniquet on stage at Flevo Festival in 2008.\n\nIn fall 2009, Gaines released his first solo effort titled Breakfast @ Timothy's.\n\nOn September 6, 2011, Gaines began endorsing Overture Guitars with a signature model, the Overture Stronghold TG Bass.\n\nIn September 2016, Stryper frontman Michael Sweet announced that the band would be going on hiatus due to personal issues affecting bassist Timothy Gaines. The hiatus would begin once the band had completed the To Hell With the Devil 30th Anniversary Tour. Sweet stated that they did not plan to continue as a band without Gaines after that time. During the hiatus the band members stated that they would pray about the direction of the band going forward. Later Sweet stated that Gaines was moving on from the personal issues and would take time to decide what he wanted to do in regards to the band. While Sweet disliked the idea of continuing without Gaines, he stated that he was open to filling the position of bassist with the right person if necessary. Gaines then confirmed that he was no longer a member of the band.\n\nFollowing the hiatus, the band issued a statement advising that Gaines had been fired from the band, removing him from the roster on the band's website. Gaines claimed that he was kicked out after he was given an ultimatum by the band.",

  "St. James, Missouri\n\nSt. James is a city in Phelps County, Missouri, United States. The population was 4,216 at the 2010 census.\n\nHistory\n\nThe settlement was originally known as Big Prairie because of its location on the natural prairie of that name in the area. In 1859, when a man by the name of John Wood anticipated the extension of the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway, the settlement became known for a short time as Scioto, named after the town of Scioto, Ohio, where many of the town's early settlers originated. In 1860, the town was named St. James to honor Thomas James, who came from Ohio and created the Meramec Iron Works. The town was intended as a shipping point for the Meramec Iron Works, which had been shipping its products by wagon train.\n\nSt. James was the part-time home of Lucy Wortham James, a wealthy philanthropist who had a love for the area. She was a descendant of Thomas James, a Chillicothe banker who founded the Maramec Iron Works. The James Foundation, a charitable organization she founded, was responsible for the St. James City Park and the James Memorial Library, as well as Maramec Spring Park. The City of St. James now owns both the park and the public library.\n\nMayme Ousley, the first woman elected mayor of a town in Missouri, was first elected mayor of St. James in 1921.

  "Chase Library\n\nChase Library is the public library of West Harwich, Massachusetts. It is located in a small architecturally distinguished Colonial Revival building constructed in 1911. Efforts to build a library in West Harwich began in 1901, and reached fruition in 1906, with the gift of the home of Caleb Chase, a Harwich native who was son of a major local shipowner and shipbuilder and a successful businessman in his own right. The house, however, was not suitable for housing a library, so Dr. John Nickerson donated a corner of his large property that was near Chase's house for the purpose, and the present building, a small three-bay wood frame hip-roof building was constructed there.\n\nThe library building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014.",
  "Clipped tag\n\nThe clipped tag is a radio frequency identification (RFID) tag designed to enhance consumer privacy. RFID is an identification technology in which information stored in semiconductor chips contained in RFID tags is communicated by means of radio waves to RFID readers. The most simple passive RFID tags do not have batteries or transmitters. They get their energy from the field of the reader. They transfer their information to the reader by modulating the signal that is reflected back to the reader by the tag. Because tags depend on the reader for power their range is limited, typically up to 10 meters for UHF RFID tags.\n\nToday, the public uses RFID tags for many applications including electronic toll collection, E-ZPass for example, or the Speedpass which is used as a credit token for the purchase of gasoline. The retail supply chain uses RFID tags to monitor the passage of pallets and cases at loading dock doors. The expectation for the future is for RFID tags to be used for the labelling of items for retail sale. Concerns for individual privacy have been raised because the RFID tags may be read by invisible radio waves without the knowledge of the holder of the tagged item.\n\nThe privacy-protecting RFID tag, the \u201cclipped tag\u201d has been suggested by IBM. The clipped tag puts the option of privacy protection in the hands of the consumer. After the point of sale, a consumer may tear off a portion of the tag, much like the way in which a ketchup packet is opened. This allows the transformation of a long-range tag into a proximity tag that still may be read, but only at short range \u2013 less than a few inches or centimeters. The modification of the tag may be confirmed visually. The tag may still be used later for returns, recalls, or recycling. The clipped tag was listed among the Wall Street Journal Technology Innovation Winners for 2006. Two US patents were issued for this invention in 2007.\n\nOther mechanisms designed to protect privacy for RFID item tagging for retail use are the EPCglobal kill command and the RSA blocker tag.\n\nClipped tag development\n\nThe concept of the clipped tag was first introduced in a paper authored by IBM researchers Paul Moskowitz and Guenter Karjoth in 2005, RFID Journal, November 7, 2005. In their paper, presented at the 2005 ACM Workshop on Privacy in the Electronic Society, the authors suggest that by providing the consumer with a means to shorten the antenna, the read range of the tag may be reduced from many meters to just a few centimeters. Several mechanisms were suggested. The mechanisms included perforating the tag like a sheet of postage stamps to allow the tearing off of a portion of the antenna. Another proposed mechanism was to manufacture the tag antenna with exposed conducting lines which could be scratched off by the consumer.\n\nIBM teamed up with Marnlen RFiD, a manufacturer of RFID labels, and Printronix, a maker of RFID printers, to demonstrate prototypes of the Clipped Tag, Wired News, May 1, 2006. The tag took the form of a garment hang tag with v-shaped notches in the edges and perforations to direct the tearing of the tag. Reactions by RFID privacy experts were favorable to the invention. According to Wired, Robert Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, said \"The Clipped Tag shows that IBM is addressing privacy concerns, even those that are unreasonable.\" Subsequently, IBM and Marnlen RFiD announced that Marnlen had licensed the technology from IBM and was shipping samples to select users, RFID Update, November, 2006.",

  "London 1883 chess tournament\n\nThe London 1883 chess tournament was a strong chess tournament among most of the leading players of the day. It was won convincingly by Johannes Zukertort (22 points out of 26) ahead of Wilhelm Steinitz (with 19 points). Remarkably, Zukertort was already assured of victory with three rounds to go, having scored an astonishing 22/23. He then lost his last three games against relatively weak players, probably due to exhaustion. The tournament established Zukertort as rivalling Steinitz to claim to be the best player in the world, and led to the World Chess Championship 1886 match between the two (the first official World Chess Championship match). The event was a double round-robin tournament. Marmaduke Wyvill contributed to organizing the tournament.\n\nThe tournament was also notable for the first use of the double-sided chess clock, invented and manufactured by Thomas Bright Wilson of Manchester Chess Club.\n\nA common story relates to an incident that occurred at the tournament banquet, when the St. George Chess Club President proposed a toast to the best chess player in the world and both Steinitz and Zukertort stood up at the same time to thank him. Research by Edward Winter suggests that this story has been embellished. A game between Mason and Winawer was played, adjourned and resumed, but upon resumption the black knight on e7 was mistakenly placed on d7. Neither player noticed at the time and Winawer played the illegal, but powerful, Nc5! setting up a Ne4+ and eventually winning the match, with the mistake not being spotted until after the game concluded. It was not until days later that the mistake was noticed.\n\nThe tournament book was dedicated to Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, for his patronage of the tournament.\n\nCrosstable\n\nThe results and standings:\n\nIn this tournament a game ending in a draw was replayed at least twice. The third game after two draws would count, whatever the result. In the table, \"+\" indicates win by default, \"-\" indicates loss by default or unplayed game, \"d\" inicates a drawn game that was replayed and not counted towards the final score.\n\nSkipworth withdrew from the tournament two games after the half way point; the remainder of his games were scored as losses. The final game between Rosenthal and Blackburne was not replayed as by that point it was clear that it would have had no impact on the final result of the tournament.",
  "Paduraksa\n\nPaduraksa, also known as kori is a type of gateway covered with towering roof that can be found in the island of Java and Bali, Indonesia. This architectural feature is commonly found in buildings from the classical Hindu-Buddhist period of Indonesia. Paduraksa marks the threshold into the most sacred space (the inner sanctum) within a religious compound, a cemetery, or a palace. In Balinese architecture, an elaborately decorated towering paduraksa is often built as the temple's most imposing structure.\n\nForm\n\nA paduraksa is basically a gateway in the form of a candi. The structure consists of three parts: the base, where a flight of steps is located; the body where the entrance opening is located; and the crown, with its stepped profile characteristic of a candi. The entrance opening is sometimes equipped with a door made of finely carved wood.\n\nOne of the oldest surviving paduraksa gates is Bajang Ratu in Trowulan, an elegant red-brick paduraksa gate dating from the mid-14th century Majapahit. The Bajang Ratu gate is adorned with a bas-reliefs depicting the story of Sri Tanjung and Ramayana. The form of the structure is tall and slender, rising to a height of 16.5 metres and displaying intricate relief decoration, especially on the roof section.\n\nWhile the basic form of a paduraksa is a stepped candi, it can be heavily decorated with ornaments, figures, and symbols. In Bali, the crown of the paduraksa is decorated with flame-like ornaments and celestial figures. The menacing head of the bhoma or fierce kala is often carved over the opening, while a lion-like effigies, or a pair of fierce giants of dvarapalas, guard the sides of the entrance. Both menacing figures of kala's head and dvarapalas door guardians are believed to have protective property; to repel and drive away evil spirits from entering the compound.\n\nThe main kori that marks the threshold into the inner sanctum of the main shrine is known as the kori agung (\"great kori\"). A paduraksa in the Islamic cemetery complex of Sendang Duwur contains a mysterious wing-like feature thought to represent the wings of the meru; this might be associated with the celestial bird garuda.\n\nClassical Javanese and Balinese Hindu temple\n\nPaduraksa and candi bentar (another gateway feature) are integral features of a Balinese Hindu temple architecture, and possibly the classical Javanese Hindu temple. Both gateways mark the threshold between different level of sanctity within a temple compound. In Bali, a candi bentar marks the boundary between the outer world with the outer realm of the Hindu temple, the nista mandala (\"outer sanctum\"), while the paduraksa marks the boundary between the madya mandala (\"middle sanctum\") with the innermost and the most sacred utama mandala (\"main sanctum\").\n\nIn Balinese temple architecture, a major temple usually has triple paduraksa gates, the main largest and tallest paduraksa, flanked with two smaller ones. Daily devotees and casual visitors usually use the side doors, while the main door is kept locked, except during religious festivals. In Bali, the paduraksa central gate is reserved for the priests and the gods.\n\nOrigin and evolution\n\nThe paduraksa is a classical Indonesian adaptation of the classical Indian gopuram. The early form of a Javanese roofed gateway can be found in a couple of 8th to 9th-century temple complexes in Central Java, e.g. Prambanan, Plaosan, and Ratu Boko. In the later period, these gateways took a more slender form. Reliefs showing a candi bentar and paduraksa have been discovered in 13th-century Candi Jago in East Java. The 13th- to 14th-century paduraksa of East Java, such as those found from the Hindu period of Singhasari and Majapahit, looks identical with the Balinese paduraksa. In the archaeological site of Trowulan \u2013 the 14th-century capital of the Majapahit empire \u2013 a paduraksa named Bajang Ratu (Javanese \"dwarf/defect monarch\"), is the oldest paduraksa that still stands. Bajang Ratu paduraksa entrance contains round holes, indicating that a double-leaf door once existed here. The paduraksa is still widely used upon the arrival of the Islam period in the 15th century. The name kori agung is usually chosen for a paduraksa which is used for non-Hindu purposes. The Great Mosque of Mataram (Mesjid Gedhe Mataram) in Kotagede contains a kori agung which marks the threshold into the mosque; where the tomb of Panembahan Senopati is located. The 16th-century Menara Kudus Mosque, one of the oldest mosque in Java, has a kori agung in its compound and a kori agung inside the mosque. Many kraton (palace) complexes of Islamic Java uses kori agung within its complex, e.g. within the Kraton Ngayogyakarta Hadiningrat of Yogyakarta Sultanate, Kraton Kasepuhan and Kanoman of Cirebon Sultanate and the ruined Kraton Kaibon of Banten Sultanate. Muslim cemetery complex also utilized the kori agung to mark the area where the tomb is located, e.g. in Imogiri cemetery complex. The Sendang Duwur cemetery complex has two kori agungs with wing-like architectural form, which is thought to represent a winged Meru.",

The army fought as part of the Red Army on the Eastern Front during World War II. The army was commanded throughout most of the war by Mikhail Katukov.\n\nIt fought in the early defense during the Battle of Stalingrad, and Operation Uranus, and participated in the Battle of Kursk, Proskurov-Chernovtsy Operation, Lvov-Sandomierz Operation, Vistula-Oder Offensive and the Battle of Berlin. After the war, the army was stationed in East Germany as part of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany.\n\nAfter the end of the Cold War and the resultant withdrawal of Soviet units in Germany, the army was relocated to Smolensk, and disbanded in 1999. The army was reformed in 2014 as part of Russia's military expansion. This reformed army fought in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, where it is said to have suffered heavy casualties following its eventual retreats from the Northeast and later Kharkiv.\n\nFirst formation\n\nThe 1st Tank Army was first formed within the Stalingrad Front from the 38th Army in July 1942, under the command of Major General Kirill Moskalenko. The army was encircled and partially destroyed. It was disbanded as a result in August 1942, its headquarters becoming the Southeastern Front headquarters.\n\nSecond formation\n\nThe 1st Tank Army was formed a second time on 30 January 1943 (order No.46021) from the headquarters of the 29th Army, under the command of famous armoured troops commander Lieutenant General of Tank Troops Mikhail Katukov, personally appointed by Stalin. The army was transferred to the North-Western Front. The 3rd Mechanised Corps (later to become 8th Guards Mechanised Corps) and 6th Tank Corps (later to become 11th Guards Tank Corps) joined it on formation, and served with the army throughout the war.\n\nIt was quickly transferred to Voronezh Front for the defense of the Kursk salient's southern shoulder. It was awarded a Guards title and became the 1st Guards Tank Army in April 1944, and Katukov was promoted to Colonel General.\n\nOn 1 January 1945, the Army's principal combat formations were:\n\n* Guards Mortar Regiment (or Battalion) (\u0433\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043a (\u0434\u0438\u0432\u0438\u0437\u0438\u043e\u043d)) was the overt designation used for Katyusha rocket launcher units.\n\nIt participated in the Battle of Kursk, the Proskurov-Chernovtsy Operation, Lvov-Sandomierz Operation, the Vistula-Oder Offensive, and the Battle of Berlin.\n\nThe 1st Guards Tank Army was awarded the Order of the Red Banner postwar. It became part of the Soviet occupation force in Germany, known as Group of Soviet Forces in Germany, with its headquarters in Dresden. In 1968, it, along with the 11th Guards Tank and 20th Guards Motor Rifle Divisions, took part in the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, and then immediately returned to their respective garrisons.\n\nIn the late 1980s the Army included the 20th Guards Motor Rifle Division, 9th Tank Division, and 11th Guards Tank Division. The headquarters was withdrawn to Smolensk, in the Moscow Military District in the early 1990s, and lost the 'Tank' from its title in 1995. In its last period within the Russian Army it comprised the 4th Guards 'Kantemir' Tank Division and the 144th Motor Rifle Division (which had been withdrawn from Tallinn in Estonia). It was disbanded in 1998.\n\n1988 structure\n\nThe army's composition in 1988 was (with main equipment), with honorific titles in italics:\n\nReactivation\n\nAfter a 15-year hiatus, the Army was reconstituted in November 2014, probably on 13 November 2014.\n\nThe army was formed as the main ground forces manoeuvre and reserve operational formation of the Western Military District, in addition to the 6th Combined Arms Army (headquartered in Saint Petersburg) and the 20th Guards Combined Arms Army (headquartered in Voronezh). It is considered an elite formation of the Russian Ground Forces. The army carries on the traditions of the chronologically first army of the Soviet Union to reach  'Guards' status.\n\nIt commands the 2nd Guards Motor Rifle and the 4th Guards Tank Divisions, which are considered the elite formations of their respective combat arms. The most decorated divisions of the Soviet Army, they were garrisoned the closest to Moscow. Due to their proximity to the capital, extra scrutiny was applied to personnel of these formations, making these postings especially prestigious. These units received the latest hardware and were thus known as the 'household' divisions of the Soviet Army. Their loyalty to the government was demonstrated by their involvement in the 1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt. The divisions retained their elite status within the Russian Army. The army also included the 6th Separate Guards Tank and the 27th Separate Guards Motor Rifle Brigades.\n\nToday the Army is composed of:\n\nRusso-Ukrainian War\n\nDuring the 2021\u20132022 Russo-Ukrainian crisis, elements of the 1st Guards Tank Army were reported to have forward deployed to the Pogonovo training ground south of Voronezh. Main battle tanks, self-propelled and towed artillery, and long-range multiple rocket launchers (MRLs), reportedly drawn from the 4th Guards Tank Division and the 2nd Motorised Rifle Division, were reported to have been positioned in the vicinity of Voronezh. A few months before the invasion, the 47th Guards Tank Division was formed from the 6th Separate Guards Tank Brigade.\n\nAfter the invasion began in February 2022, the Army took part in the Northeastern Ukraine offensive of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, with the 2nd Guards MRD taking part in the failed Siege of Chernihiv. After 3 weeks of fighting 1st Guards Tank Army had lost 409 men (61 KIA, 209 WIA, 44 missing, 96 surrendered) and 308 units of military equipment according to Russian military documents according to Ukraine.\n\nThe United Kingdom Ministry of Defence reported on 19 May 2022 that army commander General-Lieutenant Sergey Kisel had been suspended for his failure to capture Kharkiv. On 13 September 2022, UK Defence Intelligence identified 1st Guards Tank Army as the primary force that retreated from Kharkiv Oblast during the Ukrainian Kharkiv counteroffensive. Having suffered heavy casualties, it described the army as \"severely degraded\" and its ability to counter NATO \"severely weakened.\"",

  "Lifting-line theory\n\nThe Prandtl lifting-line theory is a mathematical model that predicts lift distribution over a three-dimensional wing based on its geometry. It is also known as the Lanchester\u2013Prandtl wing theory.\n\nThe theory was expressed independently by Frederick W. Lanchester in 1907, and by Ludwig Prandtl in 1918\u20131919 after working with Albert Betz and Max Munk.\n\nIn this model, the bound vortex loses strength along the whole wingspan because it is shed as a vortex-sheet from the trailing edge, rather than just as a single vortex from the wing-tips.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIt is difficult to predict analytically the overall amount of lift that a wing of given geometry will generate. When analyzing a three-dimensional finite wing, the first approximation to understanding is to consider slicing the wing into cross-sections and analyzing each cross-section independently as a wing in a two-dimensional world. Each of these slices is called an airfoil, and it is easier to understand an airfoil than a complete three-dimensional wing.\n\nOne might expect that understanding the full wing simply involves adding up the independently calculated forces from each airfoil segment. However, it turns out that this approximation is grossly incorrect: on a real wing, the lift over each wing segment (local lift per unit span, ).\n\nPrinciple\n\nThe lifting-line theory applies the concept of circulation and the Kutta\u2013Joukowski theorem,\n\nDerivation\n\n(Based on. )\n\nNomenclature:\n\nLift and drag from coefficients\n\nThe lift can be determined by integrating the circulation terms:\n\nis the span efficiency factor\n\nSymmetric wing\n\nFor a symmetric wing, the even terms of the series coefficients are identically equal to 0, and so can be dropped.\n\nRolling wings\n\nWhen the aircraft is rolling, an additional term can be added that adds the wing station distance multiplied by the rate of roll to give additional angle of attack change. Equation 3 then becomes:\n\nis the dimensionless rolling rate.\n\nA similar change in induced drag is also present when the wing is flapping, and comprises the main production of thrust for flapping wings.\n\nControl deflection\n\nThe effects of control surface deflection can be accounted for by simply changing the term changes on each side of the wing.\n\nElliptical wings\n\nFor an elliptical wing with no twist, with:\n\nis the chord.\n\nDecomposed Fourier solution\n\nA decomposed Fourier series solution can be used to individually study the effects of planform, twist, control deflection, and rolling rate.\n\nUseful approximations\n\nA useful approximation is that\n\nInteresting solutions\n\nAccording to lifting-line theory, any wing planform can be twisted to produce an elliptic lift distribution.\n\nLimitations of the theory\n\nThe lifting line theory does not take into account the following:",

  "Cascade Caverns salamander\n\nThe Cascade Caverns salamander (Eurycea latitans), or Cascade Caverns neotenic salamander, is a species of aquatic salamander endemic to Cascade Caverns in Kendall County, Texas. Like other species of cave salamanders, they are almost entirely subterranean, living in spring waters deep in limestone rock strata, so gauging the exact extent of their geographic range or even their population numbers is virtually impossible. This also leads to reduced sampling for study, which has led to some uncertainty in the taxonomic classification; some sources consider all species of Texas cave salamanders to be subspecies of the Texas salamander. Eurycea neotenes and Eurycea rathbuni also live in caves and eat small insects and spiders.\n\nDescription\n\nThe Cascade Caverns salamander is translucent, with a faint net-shaped pattern that is brown in color, often with white speckling. The species is rarely seen, so the amount of variation in their coloration is unknown. They are neotenic, meaning they retain characteristics into adulthood that are usually associated with juvenile salamanders, such as external gills. They have stout bodies, with short legs, and reduced eyes set under a layer of skin. This species of salamanders is threatened and could become endangered.",

Her mother arranged her marriage to her first cousin Thomas Hamilton, 6th Earl of Haddington in 1696, at which point she became the countess of Haddington.\n\nCareer\n\nHope lived with her husband at Leslie House in Fife and had the first of four children, who was named Charles and had the title of Lord Binning from birth. Charles would become a politician and Knight Marshal of Scotland. In 1700, the family moved to the earl's ancestral home, Tyninghame House in Haddingtonshire. Hope immediately wanted to plant trees despite the initial disinterest of her husband and local people.\n\nShe decided to plant trees on the moorland of Tyninghame and call it Binning Wood in honour of her son. The 800 acre estate was planted with 50 species of tree. In addition, she created a wilderness zone and a bowling green from where 14 walks began. Her husband wrote Short Treatise on Forest Trees (published posthumously in 1756 and later reissued as Treatise on the Manner of Raising Forest Trees in 1761), in which he praised Hope's efforts.\n\nDeath and legacy\n\nHope died in Edinburgh on 19 April 1768 at the age of 90. She was buried alongside her husband (who had predeceased her) at Tyninghame. An obelisk constructed in 1856 by Thomas Hamilton, 9th Earl of Haddington pays tribute to the couple's extensive planting.\n\nBinning Wood was clearfelled in the 1940s as part of the war effort. The Landowners\u2019 Co-operative Society Limited of Edinburgh recorded 89% of the wood was hardwood (oak and beech) and the remainder was softwood, mainly Scots pine. Some of the beechwood was used to construct de Havilland Mosquito fighter planes. It was replanted in a program which took until 1960 to complete, with the trees mainly being Scots pine since hardwood seedlings were not available. The earl of Haddington ensured the original 1707 layout was adhered to and the work was done by Italian prisoners of war. In the 2010s, part of the wood became a green funeral site, with individual plots costing \u00a3950.",

  "J. O. Tobin\n\nJ. O. Tobin (March 28, 1974 \u2013 May 22, 1994) was an American-bred thoroughbred racehorse. As a two-year-old, he was sent to Europe, where he won his first three races, including the Richmond Stakes and Champagne Stakes, and was the highest-rated juvenile of the season in Britain. In the following year, he was transferred to the United States, where he recorded his most famous victory as he ended the undefeated streak of the Triple Crown winner Seattle Slew with a win in the Swaps Stakes. In the following year, he won a succession of major stakes races and was named American Champion Sprint Horse.\n\nBackground\n\nJ. O. Tobin was an \"impressive-looking\" brown colt, with a small white star bred in Maryland by his owner, George A. Pope Jr. He was sired by Never Bend, the American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt of 1962 who went on to become a very successful breeding stallion whose other progeny included Mill Reef, Riverman, and Triple Bend. J. O. Tobin's dam, Hill Shade, was an American-bred mare who raced in Europe, winning the Nassau Stakes and Sun Chariot Stakes in 1968 and being awarded a rating of 116 by Timeform. Before foaling J.O. Tobin, she had produced an outstanding performer in Mysterious, winner of the 1000 Guineas and Oaks Stakes in 1973.\n\nPope initially sent his colt to race in England, where he was trained by Noel Murless in Newmarket, Suffolk.\n\n1976: two-year-old season\n\nJ.O. Tobin began his racing career with a win over Chain of Reasoning in the Fulbourn Maiden Stakes over six furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse on 8 July. Three weeks later, the colt was moved up in class for the Group Two Richmond Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse. Ridden by Lester Piggott, he started the 8/11 favourite and won from Priors Walk and Tachypous, a colt who later won the Middle Park Stakes.\n\nJ.O. Tobin's next race was the Champagne Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse in September, for which he was made the 4/9 favourite. In what was described by Timeform as a \"breathtaking\" performance, Piggott sat motionless on the colt until the final furlong, at which point J.O. Tobin accelerated clear of his rivals to win by four lengths from the filly Durtal. The form of the race was subsequently boosted when Durtal won the Cheveley Park Stakes and was rated the best two-year-old filly of the year in Britain. On his final appearance of the season, J.O. Tobin was matched against the outstanding French two-year-old Blushing Groom in a highly anticipated race for the Grand Crit\u00e9rium over 1600 metres at Longchamp Racecourse on 10 October. Blushing Groom, ridden by Henri Samani, started 4/5 favourite after wins in the Prix Robert Papin, Prix Morny and Prix de la Salamandre whilst J.O. Tobin, ridden as usual by Piggott, started at odds of 5/4. Piggott tracked Samani, but when Blushing Groom took the lead in the straight, J.O. Tobin was unable to maintain his challenge and finished third, beaten four lengths and a head by Blushing Groom and Amyntor.\n\n1977: three-year-old season\n\nWhen Murless retired at the end of the 1976 season, Pope brought the horse back to the United States, where he was trained by former jockey and U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee John H. Adams. For his new trainer, the colt won the Coronado Handicap at Hollywood Park Racetrack in April and then finished fifth behind Seattle Slew in the Preakness Stakes. By the time J.O. Tobin met Seattle Slew in the Swaps Stakes, the latter had completed the Triple Crown in the Belmont Stakes to take his winning sequence to nine. J.O. Tobin led from the start and quickly went clear of Seattle Slew and Text. On the final turn, Seattle Slew began to weaken, and J.O. Tobin steadily increased his advantage in the straight. He beat Affiliate by 8-lengths in a time of 1:58 missing the track and world record for 1 miles by two-fifths of a second. Seattle Slew finished 4th, 16 lengths behind. Ridden by Bill Shoemaker, J.O. Tobin led from start to finish, running very fast fractions of 22 to the 1/4 mile, 45 to the 1/2 mile, 1:09 to the 3/4 mile & 1:33 to the mile.\n\n1978: four-year-old season\n\nIn 1978, J. O. Tobin's race conditioning was taken over by future Hall of Fame trainer Laz Barrera, who guided him to wins in six Graded stakes races and American Champion Sprint Horse honors. On his first appearance of the season, he won the Malibu Stakes by five and a half lengths at Santa Anita Park in January. He went on to win the Californian Stakes, Tom Fool Handicap, Los Angeles Handicap, San Bernardino Handicap, and Premiere Handicap. He was voted American Champion Sprint Horse at the Eclipse Awards for 1978.\n\nAssessment\n\nThere was no International Classification of European two-year-olds in 1976: the official handicappers of Britain, Ireland, and France compiled separate rankings for horses which competed in those countries. In the British Free Handicap, J.O. Tobin was given top-weight of 133 pounds, five pounds ahead of Godswalk, eight ahead of The Minstrel, and eleven ahead of Nebbiolo. The independent Timeform organisation gave him a rating of 130, making him their second best two-year-old of the year, a pound behind Blushing Groom.\n\nRetirement\n\nJ. O. Tobin was retired to stud in 1979 and his first crop of foals proved to be hugely popular in the sales ring. He was the leading freshman sire at the Keeneland yearling sales in 1981 ahead of his old adversary, Seattle Slew but overall he was not a success as a breeding stallion. He died in 1994 in Corrales, New Mexico.",
  "Raphael Ravenscroft\n\nRaphael Ravenscroft (4 June 1954 \u2013 19 October 2014) was a British musician, composer and author. He is best known for playing the saxophone on Gerry Rafferty's song \"Baker Street\".\n\nEarly life\n\nWhile his place of birth is disputed, the England and Wales Birth Index places it at Stoke-on-Trent. He was the eldest son of Trevor Ravenscroft, author of the 1972 occult book The Spear of Destiny, and spent much of his young life in Dumfries, where his father lived.\n\nGerry Rafferty and \"Baker Street\"\n\nIn January 1978, Scottish singer-musician Gerry Rafferty released his first solo material since 1972 and first material of any kind since the demise of Stealers Wheel in 1975. As a then-unheralded session musician, Ravenscroft was asked to play the saxophone on the album City to City (1978). His contribution included the sax riff on the best-known song from the album and of Rafferty's career, \"Baker Street\". The song was an international hit, charting at number 3 in the UK and number 2 in the US. \"Baker Street\" was reported in 2010 as having received 5 million air plays worldwide to date. City to City reached number 1 in the US album charts and went platinum. In the UK the album reached number 6 and went gold.\n\nRavenscroft told the BBC's The One Show in 2010 that he was only paid \u00a327.50 for the \"Baker Street\" session, which was the Musicians' Union rate at the time. It has been (falsely) reported that the cheque bounced and that it was kept on the wall of Ravenscroft's solicitors; in contrast, the song is said to have earned Rafferty \u00a380,000 a year in royalties.\n\nThe saxophone break on \"Baker Street\" has been described as \"the most famous saxophone solo of all time\", \"the most recognizable sax riff in pop music history\", and \"one of the most recognisable saxophone solos of all time\".\n\nIn a radio interview in 2011, Ravenscroft said that his performance on the song annoyed him. \"I'm irritated because it's out of tune\", he said. \"Yeah, it's flat. By enough of a degree that it irritates me at best.\" Ravenscroft mostly refused to play \"Baker Street\" during interviews. The last time Ravenscroft played \"Baker Street\" was in the summer of 2014 when he organised a charity gala concert in Exeter for Nicole Hartup, a 12-year-old city schoolgirl who had died in a fall.\n\nRavenscroft worked with Rafferty from 1977 to 1982. As well as the songs he worked on for City to City he contributed to Rafferty's next two albums, Night Owl (1979) on which he played the lyricon on the title track of the album, and follow-up album Snakes and Ladders (1980).\n\nIn 2011, he recorded a tribute to commemorate the funeral of Gerry Rafferty called \"Forgiveness\", which combined his saxophone playing with the voices of Grammy-nominated choir Tenebrae.\n\nWhile Ravenscroft falsely claimed to have made the decision to incorporate the riff (based, he said, on \"an old blues riff\") into \"Baker Street\", earlier demo recordings for \"Baker Street\" have the same refrain, played by Rafferty on guitar, which were recorded before Ravenscroft became involved in the sessions for the song, indicating that Ravenscroft was not responsible for including the melody in the song. An almost identical riff had actually been written ten years earlier for the 1968 Steve Marcus jazz track \"Half a Heart\", and it has been suggested by Gary Burton, a friend of Marcus, that Ravenscroft's performance on \"Baker Street\" was likely influenced by the earlier song.\n\nOther work\n\nFrom his breakthrough with \"Baker Street\" he went on to perform with Pink Floyd (The Final Cut, 1983), ABBA and Marvin Gaye. Other Ravenscroft performing credits include work with America, Maxine Nightingale, Daft Punk, Kim Carnes, The Only Ones, Mike Oldfield, Chris Rea, Robert Plant, Brand X, Hazel O'Connor and Bonnie Tyler. In 1979, he released the solo album Her Father Didn't Like Me, Anyway (CBS Portrait JR 35683). In 1983, Ravenscroft released the track \"Maxine\" which gained airplay, but performed poorly on the charts. In 1987, he was credited, along with Max Early and Johnny Patrick for the new theme to the Central Television soap opera Crossroads.\n\nIn 2010, Ravenscroft played on albums and on sessions with Duffy, Mary Hopkin and Jamie Hartman. In 2011\u201312, Ravenscroft contributed to the album Propeller by Grice.\n\nRavenscroft wrote several books on saxophone technique, including The Complete Saxophone Player (1990).\n\nIn 2012, Ravenscroft created the music for a series of films featuring photographer Don McCullin, and during 2011\u20132012 composed for several major advertising campaigns around the world. In summer 2012 he took a break due to ill-health, and moved back to Devon.\n\nIn 2014, Ravenscroft went to Belgium to help and set up the saxophone project Wie is Sax4Pax? with the company Adolphe Sax & Cie.\n\nPersonal life and death\n\nHe married and divorced twice, and separated from his third wife in 2009. His daughter is the artist Scarlett Raven. Ravenscroft died on 19 October 2014 at the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital, aged 60, of a suspected heart attack.\n\nCollaborations\n\nPictures at Eleven, Robert Plant, Pledge Pin",

The broker for this transaction was Doug Ferber of Star Media Group, Inc. WRNX was later sold to Clear Channel Communications in 2006.\n\nFor a period of time after the purchase, WPNI was leased to the University of Massachusetts Amherst, owner of NPR member station WFCR, to provide an AM feed of the NPR News and Ideas channel.

  "Yuan Zhen (Jin dynasty)\n\nYuan Zhen (died 370), courtesy name Yanren, was a Chinese military general of the Jin dynasty (266\u2013420). He had a long career serving the Jin dynasty but he was mostly known for his rebellion in 370. After failing to build a canal to secure the Jin forces' supply route during Huan Wen's campaign against Former Yan, Huan Wen was quick to blame Yuan Zhen after he returned defeated. In response, Yuan Zhen revolted in Shouchun in 369 but would die not long after. His son Yuan Qin continued the rebellion, but he was defeated and executed in 371.\n\nCareer under the Jin dynasty\n\nNot much is known about Yuan Zhen's background or early life except that he originated from Chen Commandery. He appeared to have first served as one of Yu Yi's general in the 340s. After Yu Yi's death in 345, one of his peers Gan Zan (\u5e72\u74da) decided to revolt and kill Yu Yi's Champion General Cao Ju (\u66f9\u64da). Yuan Zhen allied himself with Jiang Bin (\u6c5f\u8668), Zhu Dao (\u6731\u71fe) and Mao Muzhi, and together they put down the rebellion.\n\nYuan Zhen was present during the early northern expeditions that followed Later Zhao's hasty decline in 350. He was serving as Administrator of Lujiang around this time, and he captured Ran Wei's city of Hefei in 350. Later in 356, Yuan Zhen, now as Dragon-Soaring General, helped repair the imperial tombs in Luoyang after Huan Wen successfully captured the city. In 362, he was stationed in Runan after he was made General of the Household Gentlemen of the West, Chief of military affairs in Yuzhou, Sizhou, Bingzhou, and Jizhou, and Inspector of Yuzhou.\n\nAt Runan, Yuan Zhen helped defend Luoyang from the Former Yan threat. The Yan general L\u00fc Hu (\u5442\u8b77) attacked Luoyang in 362, so Yuan Zhen assisted by keeping the ancient capital supplied with rice before falling back to Shouchun. Yuan Zhen's authority was further strengthened as he was appointed Chief Controller in Sizhou, Jizhou, and Bingzhou in 363. The following year in 364, Yan's regent Murong Ping led the attack together with Li Hong (\u674e\u6d2a). Huan Wen ordered Yuan Zhen to defend Pengcheng while carving out a road to help the transport of supplies. Ultimately, Luoyang fell to Yan in 365, as Emperor Ai of Jin's death forced Huan Wen to withdraw.\n\nYuan Zhen was one of the main benefactors in Huan Wen's expedition to conquer Former Yan in 369 together with Huan Chong, Chi Yin (\u90d7\u6114) and others. During the campaign, Huan Wen was faced with a recurring problem as his supply routes were held back by a drought that made the rivers too shallow for his ships to sail. Huan Wen sent Yuan Zhen to attack Qiao and Liangguo commanderies to open up the dam at Shimen (\u77f3\u9580; north of present-day Fuyang, Anhui) and allow water to flow through the rivers. However, Yuan Zhen did capture the commanderies, but he could not release the water from the dam. Furthermore, Yan forces led by Murong De later arrived at Shimen and defeated Yuan Zhen's army. As a result, Huan Wen's supply could not reach him, contributing to his decisive defeat at the Battle of Fangtou.\n\nYuan Zhen's Rebellion\n\nHuan Wen was furious and humiliated by his latest defeat. He fully blamed Yuan Zhen for not securing his supply route, but part of this also had to do with Huan Wen wanting to save face and deflect fault. Huan Wen demanded the court strip him off his office and reduce him to a commoner. Yuan Zhen called his accusations slanders and refused to accept it. Yuan Zhen sent word to the Jin court about Huan Wen's own crime, but the court ignored him. Thus, Yuan Zhen decided to rebel in Shouchun in 369, offering submission to both Former Yan and Former Qin.\n\nFormer Yan was first to received his submission, and wanted to make Yuan Zhen Commissioner Bearing Credentials and a few other important titles. However, their envoy Wen Tong (\u6eab\u7d71) passed away on the way to Yuan Zhen, so Yuan Zhen never received his titles. At the beginning of 370, Yuan Zhen suspected that his Interior Ministers Zhu Xian (\u6731\u61b2) and Zhu Bin (\u6731\u658c) were in touch with Huan Wen, so he had them both killed.\n\nYuan Zhen died naturally on the 10th of April in 370. His son Yuan Qin (\u8881\u747e) would succeed him after the Administrator of Chen Commandery, Zhu Fu (\u6731\u8f14) acclaimed him.\n\nChildren\n\nYuan Zhen had at least three sons: Yuan Shuangzi (\u8881\u96d9\u4e4b), Yuan Aizhi (\u8881\u611b\u4e4b) and Yuan Qin. Yuan Shuangzi and Yuan Aizhi were the ones who killed Zhu Xian and Zhu Bin for their father.\n\nYuan Qin\n\nYuan Qin (died 371) succeeded Yuan Zhen and continued the rebellion. Unlike his father, the rebellion's leadership was evenly distributed between him and Zhu Fu. Yan accepted Yuan Qin's succession, and made him Inspector of Yuzhou while Zhu Fu was made Inspector of Yangzhou.\n\nReinforcements from Qin and Yan were sent in to support Yuan Qin, but they were blocked by Huan Wen's generals Zhu Yao (\u7afa\u7464) and Huan Shiqian. Yuan Qin's forces were defeated by Zhu Yao at Wuqiu. Near the end of the year, a large force led by Huan Wen routed Yuan Qin at Shouchun. Yan wanted to support Yuan Qin by sending Meng Gao (\u5b5f\u9ad8) but Meng was called back due to Qin forces invading Yan.\n\nAt the beginning of 371, Yuan Qin requested aid from Qin for the last time after Qin had conquered Yan the year prior. Yuan Qin became Qin's Inspector of Yangzhou and sent Zhang Ci and Wang Jian (\u738b\u5805) to reinforce him. However, once again, Yuan Qin's reinforcements were defeated by Huan Yi and Huan Shiqian. The Qin army's defeat caused Yuan Qin's troops to scatter and Shouchun soon fell in February. Huan Wen sent Yuan Qin and Zhu Fu's clan to the capital, where they were all executed.",

  "Westland Limousine\n\nThe Westland Limousine was a 1920s British single-engined four-seat light transport aircraft built by Westland Aircraft.\n\nHistory\n\nAt the end of World War I, the prospect of an expanding aviation market led Westland Aircraft to design a light transport aircraft for three passengers. It was Westland's first commercial aeroplane and designated the Westland Limousine I. The first aircraft (initially registered K-126, but quickly re-registered G-EAFO) flew in July 1919. A biplane, it was powered by one Rolls-Royce Falcon III engine. The passengers were in an enclosed cabin and the pilot sat in the port rear of the four seats. His seat was higher to enable his head to be raised through the cabin roof. The second aircraft (G-EAJL) was designated the Limousine II and was completed in October 1919.\n\nBoth the first and second aircraft were used from September 1920 for two months on an experimental express air mail service between Croydon and Le Bourget. A third aircraft was built and was at first test-flown with a new Cosmos Jupiter engine, but later was fitted with the Falcon III. Another four aircraft were built, two of which were used by Instone Air Line to fly from London to Paris and Brussels.\n\nTo enter the Air Ministry's 1920 Commercial Aircraft Competition, the aircraft was re-designed as the larger Limousine III for five passengers. It used the 450 hp Napier Lion engine. The aircraft won the \u00a37,500 Air Ministry prize but only one more aircraft was constructed, which was later operated by Instone Air Line.\n\nThe first Limousine III (registered G-EARV) pioneered air transport in Newfoundland when it was operated by the Aerial Survey Company (Newfoundland) Ltd. (see Sidney Cotton). It was used for seal and fishery spotting including being used on skis. Two of the earlier Limousine IIs were also to end up in Newfoundland. The company operated in Newfoundland until the end of 1923, carrying mail and passengers to remote outposts.",

  "Leonard Bessemer Pfeil\n\nDr Leonard Bessemer Pfeil (13 March 1898 \u2013 16 February 1969) was a British metallurgist.\n\nEarly life\n\nLeonard Pfeil was born in London, the son of accountant Leopold Pfeil, and educated at St Dunstan's College, Catford and the Royal School of Mines, where he graduated with a BSc in 1921.\n\nCareer\n\nLeonard Pfeil was first appointed a Junior Lecturer in Metallurgy in the newly formed Metallurgy Department of the University College of Swansea, where he worked on the metallographic problems of steel and was awarded a D.Sc by the University of London in 1927.\n\nIn 1930 he moved to Birmingham to work at the Mond Nickel Company as Assistant Manager of their Research and Development Department. A variety of projects on the use of nickel alloys were suspended during the Second World War in favour of military ones, particularly the development of heat resisting alloys for use in the newly developed gas turbine engines for aircraft. Manufacturing techniques for the successful Nimonic range of nickel alloys were significantly improved.\n\nWhen the Whittle jet engine was conceived, the need was for a stronger version of the Nimonic alloy then under development (Nimonic 75). Accordingly, Nimonic 80 was developed and the manufacturing difficulties overcome to the point where an experimental jet plane (E28) with a Whittle engine (Power Jets W.2B) could be flown in 1942, easily outperforming conventional piston-engined fighters. Other projects included the development of diffusion membranes for the separation of uranium isotopes. For his wartime contributions he was awarded the OBE in the 1947 New Year Honours.\n\nAfter the war Pfeil moved to London as manager of Mond's Research and Development Department to continue his work on Nimonic alloys, becoming a director of Henry Wiggin and Co in 1946 and a director of Mond Nickel in 1951. He served on many official and institutional advisory committees and as President of the Institution of Metallurgists for 1953/54 and of the Institute of Metals for 1957.

  "Hartford Whalers\n\nThe Hartford Whalers were a professional ice hockey team based for most of its existence in Hartford, Connecticut. The club played in the World Hockey Association (WHA) from 1972 until 1979, and in the National Hockey League (NHL) from 1979 to 1997. Originally based in Boston, the team joined the WHA in the league's inaugural season, and was known as the New England Whalers throughout its time in the WHA. The Whalers moved to Hartford in 1974 and joined the NHL in the NHL\u2013WHA merger of 1979.\n\nIn 1997, the Whalers franchise relocated to North Carolina, where it became the Carolina Hurricanes.\n\nEarly seasons in Boston (1971\u20131974)\n\nThe Whalers franchise was created in November 1971 when the World Hockey Association (WHA) awarded a franchise to New England businessmen Howard Baldwin, W. Godfrey Wood, John Coburn and William Edward Barnes to begin play in Boston. The team began auspiciously, signing former Detroit Red Wings star Tom Webster, hard rock Boston Bruins' defenseman Ted Green (the team's inaugural captain), Toronto Maple Leafs' defensemen Rick Ley, Jim Dorey and Brad Selwood, and former Pittsburgh Penguins' goaltender Al Smith.\n\nNew England signed an unusually large number of American players, including Massachusetts natives and former U.S. Olympic hockey team members Larry Pleau (who had been a regular with the Montreal Canadiens the previous season), Kevin Ahearn, John Cunniff and Paul Hurley. Two other ex-U.S. Olympians on the Whalers' roster (Minnesotans Timothy Sheehy and Tommy Williams) had spent a significant part of their careers in Boston with Boston College and the Bruins, respectively.\n\nThe Whalers had the WHA's best regular season record in the 1972\u201373 season. Webster led the team in scoring and through the playoffs. Behind legendary ex-Boston University head coach Jack Kelley, the team defeated the Winnipeg Jets to win the inaugural WHA championship.\n\nThe club played its first season's home games at Boston Garden and Boston Arena. However, the Garden was owned by the rival NHL Bruins, and the Whalers found themselves fourth in priority for dates behind the Bruins, Boston Celtics and even the American Hockey League's Boston Braves. Fed up with the situation, Baldwin decided to move elsewhere.\n\nRelocation to Hartford (1974)\n\nHartford was about to open a new, modern downtown arena and convention center, the Hartford Civic Center. The city had hoped to get an American Basketball Association team as the main tenant, but when that fell through, city leaders got in touch with the Whalers. Aside from various minor league teams in New Haven, the area had been largely bereft of professional hockey until the Whalers' arrival. The Civic Center was still being finished when the 1974\u201375 season began, so the Whalers played the first part of the 1974\u201375 season at The Big E Coliseum in West Springfield, Massachusetts.\n\nOn January 11, 1975, the team played its first game at the Hartford Civic Center in front of a sellout crowd. The franchise remained in Hartford until it relocated to North Carolina for the 1997\u201398 season, save for a temporary relocation to the nearby Springfield Civic Center in the late 1970s while their Hartford arena was being rebuilt after heavy snow followed by heavy rain caused the roof, which suffered from several engineering and construction shortcomings, to collapse.\n\nThough they never again won the WHA championship, the New England Whalers were a successful team, never missing the playoffs in league history, and finishing first in their division three times. They had a more stable roster than most WHA teams: Ley, Webster, Selwood, Pleau, and Tommy Earl played over 350 games each with the club. The team scored a major coup when it signed legend Gordie Howe and his sons Mark and Marty from the Houston Aeros in 1977.\n\nThe Whalers recorded losing records in their first two full seasons in Hartford, their final two WHA seasons saw more success. They went to the finals again in 1978, with a veteran team spearheaded by the Howes\u201450-year-old Gordie led the team in scoring\u2014future NHL stars Gordie Roberts and Mike Rogers, All-Star defenseman Ron Plumb, and forwards John McKenzie, Dave Keon and Mike Antonovich, and possessed the league's best defense. The next season was not so fine, however, but while age finally caught up with Gordie Howe, the slack was picked up by Andre Lacroix, the WHA's all-time leading scorer, acquired from the Aeros.\n\nAdmission to the NHL\n\nAs the Whalers were one of the most stable WHA teams, the club was one of the four franchises admitted to the NHL when the rival leagues merged in 1979. Unlike the other former WHA teams, the Whalers were not stripped of most of their players. The Howes, Rogers, Ley, Keon, Smith, Roberts and Lacroix are the New England Whalers players who stayed on the team as it made the transition to the NHL and became the Hartford Whalers. (In the case of the Howes, Detroit intentionally turned down their option to resign longtime Red Wing Gordie, out of respect for his legacy already in place there.) Only Selwood, George Lyle and Warren Miller were reclaimed by their former NHL teams. The Whalers were the only American-based WHA team to join the NHL.\n\nThe New England Whalers renamed themselves the Hartford Whalers in May 1979, at the insistence of the Boston Bruins who objected to the team naming themselves for New England. Connecticut-based graphic designer Peter Good was hired by the Jack Lardis Associates advertising agency to design a new logo for the team. Good put a whale's tail over a \"W\", allowing the negative space between the two shapes to create an \"H\". Good also helped design the team's new uniforms for the 1979\u201380 season in the team's new colors of green and blue.\n\nNHL history\n\nThe Whalers were never as successful in the NHL as they had been in the WHA. They recorded only three winning seasons in their 18 years in the NHL, made the Stanley Cup playoffs eight times and won only one playoff series, earning the nickname \"The Forever.500s\" in mocking jest of their winning percentage. Whenever they did make the playoffs, they faced the near-certainty of having to get past the Boston Bruins or Montreal Canadiens to make it to the Conference Finals. The team developed a heated rivalry with the Bruins because they were based only 100 miles northeast of Hartford and the fact they used to play in the same arena. Home games against the Bruins usually attracted the Whalers' largest crowds, as many Bruins fans followed their team to Hartford. The Whalers had an all-time head-to-head record of 37\u201369\u201312 against Boston.\n\nThe Whalers were hampered by numerous off-ice factors. Hartford was the smallest American market in the NHL and was located on the traditional dividing line between the home territories for Boston and New York area teams. This limited the team's marketability. Additionally, for most of the Whalers' tenure as an NHL team, the Hartford Civic Center was one of the smallest arenas in the league. At its maximum, it seated just 15,635 for hockey. The team averaged over 14,000 fans only twice in its 15 years at the Civic Center. They averaged only 13,867 from 1980 to 1997. Most of their sellouts came when either the Bruins, the New York Islanders, or the New York Rangers played in Hartford, bringing thousands of their own fans with them.\n\nInaugural NHL season\n\nUpon joining the NHL, the Whalers were placed in the Norris Division of the Wales Conference. Their first NHL season in 1979\u201380 looked somewhat promising. They were led by Mike Rogers, Blaine Stoughton, Dave Keon, Mark Howe, Rick Ley, NHL legend Gordie Howe and the all-time WHA leading scorer, Andre Lacroix, along with the franchise's first starting goaltender, Al Smith. The Whalers also acquired another NHL legend, Bobby Hull, near the NHL trade deadline in 1980. They finished the season with 73 points and a playoff berth and had the best record of the four former WHA franchises that entered the NHL in 1979\u201380. The Whalers remained the most recent first year expansion franchise to make the playoffs in their inaugural season, along with the 1979\u201380 Edmonton Oilers, until the 2017\u201318 Vegas Golden Knights accomplished the feat. In the first round of the playoffs, the Whalers were swept by the Montreal Canadiens three games to none. Following this season, Gordie Howe, Bobby Hull and Andre Lacroix all announced their retirements from professional hockey.\n\nThe early 1980s\n\nFollowing the 1979\u201380 season, the Whalers had many aging veterans left over from their WHA days. To make matters worse, the Whalers reputation of making disastrous trades began to unfold, as the team began to trade away stars for mediocre players in an attempt to gain depth. For instance, they traded star defenseman Mark Howe and their first NHL scoring leader, Mike Rogers, in separate deals for players and draft picks which never panned out, and also swapped defensive-defenseman Gordie Roberts, who would go on to play 15 remaining professional seasons, for the remaining half of the season of Mike Fidler",

  "Andrew Murstein\n\nAndrew Mead Murstein (born June 29, 1964) is founder, president, board member and, with his family, the largest shareholder of Medallion Financial Corp., an investment company publicly traded on the Nasdaq stock exchange under the symbol MFIN. MFIN and its predecessor companies have invested over $10 billion in various companies throughout the U.S. Murstein received a B.A. in economics, cum laude, from Tufts University and an M.B.A. in finance from New York University. He was named among Crain's New York Business' \"40 Under 40\", and has been featured in numerous business publications. In 2013, he was appointed to the Board of the Javits Center.\n\nEarly life and career\n\nMurstein was born in Roslyn, New York to Alvin and Aileen Murstein. His grandfather of German-Jewish descent, Leon Murstein, came to the United States from Argentina, became a New York cabdriver and purchased one of the first New York taxi medallions, issued in 1937, for $10. The family went on to purchase several hundred medallions for prices as little as $10 each\u2014medallions peaked at over $1,300,000 each and currently sell for around $85,000 each.\n\nIn the 1970\u2019s, Alvin Murstein founded Medallion Funding Corp. to build a taxi medallion lending business. Medallion Funding earned returns on investment over 20 percent per year. The price of NY City medallions peaked in 2013, as the emergence of ride-hailing companies caused the first significant and sustained decline in medallion values. In order to navigate this challenge, Murstein reduced medallion lending, expanded consumer lending and restructured existing medallion loans. To better communicate the more diversified lending strategy, a stock symbol change was made from \"TAXI\" to \"MFIN\" on May 10, 2016 A decision was also made to eliminate the dividend and convert to a C corp from a Business Development Company due to tax and capital considerations. After a steep decline, shares of MFIN began to rebound in the second half of 2017. As recently as December 12, 2017, 9% senior notes issued by Medallion Financial traded for over 100% of par value, which is a significant recovery from distressed levels reached earlier in 2017, and an indication of improved investor confidence. Medallion Financials stock price (NASDAQ: MFIN) has tripled in the last year.\n\nOn May 19, 2019, New York Times published an investigative report on how medallion lending practices effected a generation of taxi drivers, citing Murstein, among others, as moving the industry toward riskier lending practices.\n\nLater life and career\n\nAfter completing his studies at Tufts University and New York University, Murstein spent several years on Wall Street, including time at Salomon Brothers, where he learned the important of equity in funding a business. He joined Medallion Funding full-time in 1990 and eventually took the company public.\n\nIn 1996, Murstein successfully launched Medallion Financial Corp., established to be the parent company of Medallion Funding, as a public company trading on the Nasdaq under the symbol MFIN. The company has financed the purchase of thousands more in Newark, Cambridge, Philadelphia, Chicago, Boston and New York City, is an established industry leader. But taxi loans are only a part of the story. The company also established or bought successful businesses that lend to a variety of small businesses such as dry cleaners, convenience stores, manufacturers, distributors, and later public companies.\n\nIn 1994, Murstein invested $1 million to create a subsidiary which sold advertising on the tops of taxis. The subsidiary, eventually named Medallion Taxi Media, was enhanced in 1996 with the acquisition of See Level Advertising. Murstein sold Medallion Taxi Media to Clear Channel yielding $35 million in 2004. About this time Medallion Financial Corp. set up its own bank, Medallion Bank, to fund many of the company's endeavors. On February 27, 2009, Medallion accepted an $11.8 million investment from the U.S. Treasury, a security which was repaid on July 21, 2011.\n\nIn 2008, Murstein along with former baseball player Hank Aaron, former New York Governor Mario Cuomo, both Medallion Financial board members, and former football star and Congressman Jack Kemp, formed a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) which raised $230 million to buy a professional sports team. The SPAC reportedly bid for the Chicago Cubs and other sports properties but ended up not making a purchase because none of the properties the company evaluated had the right mix of profit potential and risk avoidance. Later that same year, Murstein organized and filed publicly a SPAC focused on the security industry and assembled a board of directors that included former FBI Director Louis Freeh and former Pennsylvania Governor and Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge.\n\nIn 2012, Medallion Sports Group, along with partners Richard Mack and NFL player Jim Brown, Murstein acquired the Long Island Lizards of Major League Lacrosse, and renamed the team the New York Lizards. The team plays at Hofstra University on Long Island, and won the MLL championship for the third time in 2015.\n\nNASCAR team ownership\n\nOn November 8, 2010, Medallion Financial Corp., as part of an investment group which included Richard Petty, acquired the racing assets of NASCAR's, Richard Petty Motorsports. In 2017, Murstein and Petty announced that they had hired Darrell \"Bubba\" Wallace Jr., to drive the No. 43 car, becoming the first African-American driver to drive regularly in NASCAR's premier Cup Series in over 40 years. After the 2021 NASCAR Cup Series season, Murstein sold his stake in Richard Petty Motorsports (the majority ownership) to Maury Gallagher, the Chairman and CEO of Allegiant Air and owner of NASCAR team GMS Racing. As a result, RPM was renamed Petty GMS Motorsports.",
  "Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic\u2013Syria relations\n\nThe relationship between Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic and Arab Republic of Syria is regarded as a close-range relations between two countries.\n\nHistory\n\nSyria, historically, has provided political support to the Polisario, a Western Saharan-oriented group fighting against Morocco. This has prompted tensions between Morocco and Syria, which had already declined since the 1960s. Syria's close ties with Iran also gave impetus for the tensions, a fact which contributed to Syria's support to Polisario and Western Saharans against Morocco. Syria remains firmly on Western Sahara's side and has officially recognized SADR.\n\nSyrian Civil War\n\nThe Syrian Civil War has created divisions between two groups. The exiled Syrian opposition, backed by anti-Assad allies including Morocco, had been instrumental on voicing in favor to Morocco's integrity. Meanwhile, the Syrian Government led by Bashar al-Assad maintained its support for Polisario and Western Saharan cause.\n\nAlgeria allegedly allowed Polisario fighters to fight in Syria on behalf of Assad's request. And with the going end of the Syrian Civil War, and Assad's prevail, the relations would be expected to bear more fruits as Assad has remained firmly recognized to Western Saharan cause.",

  "Tail Gunner Joe\n\nTail Gunner Joe is a 1977 television movie dramatizing the life of U.S. Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, a Wisconsin Republican who claimed knowledge of communist infiltration of the U.S. government during the 1950s. The film was broadcast on NBC-TV. It was nominated for six Emmy awards and won two: best writing and best supporting actor for Burgess Meredith's portrayal of attorney Joseph N. Welch. It starred Peter Boyle (as McCarthy) and John Forsythe. Robert F. Simon appeared as journalist Drew Pearson.\n\nThe nickname 'Tail Gunner Joe' is a derisive term for the Senator that originated from his false claim to have been a tail gunner on American bombers during World War II.\n\nReception\n\nJohn Carmody wrote in The Washington Post:\"The story makes the unassailable point that McCarthy, who chased Communists around for years without every [sic] actually catching one, wouldn't have been'successful' if the media and a lot of politicians, including President Truman and Eisenhower, hadn't tolerated him. There is a certain hand-wringing quality to some of the narration Sunday night (scriptwriters long to be on the side of the angels, too) and there is a little side-stepping when it comes to explaining the sources of McCarthy's political strengths, such as they were.\"\n\nFrom a review by ModCinema:\"Tail Gunner Joe is in its own way as biased and unfair as any of Joe McCarthy's diatribes but this made-for-TV movie works as a brisk, entertaining recollection of an era in which 'guilt by association' was a byword. As Joe McCarthy, Peter Boyle's performance is so convincing that it borders on the supernatural.\"",

  "Gold Record (album)\n\nGold Record is a studio album by American musician Bill Callahan, released on September 4, 2020 by independent record label Drag City. It is the seventh studio album released under his own name, and eighteenth overall when including studio albums released as Smog.\n\nBackground\n\nGold Record was first announced on June 25, 2020. It was also announced that beginning on June 29, 2020, a new single would be released every week until the September 4, 2020 release date. Each weekly release was accompanied by a sketch drawn by Callahan. The sketches, which differed every week, were completed during preparations for a Shepherd in a Sheepskin Vest tour.\n\nThe album, which is named after the RIAA Gold certification, consists mainly of some of Callahan's old and unfinished songs. The album includes a revisitation of \"Let\u2019s Move to the Country\", the opening song from Callahan's 1999 studio album Knock Knock.\n\nGold Record, which was recorded in one week, features accompaniment by guitarist Matt Kinsey, bassist Jamie Zurverza, and drummer Adam Jones.\n\nCritical reception\n\nGold Record received positive reviews from critics upon its release. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 86, based on fifteen reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\n\nKitty Empire of The Guardian praised the album and highlighted it as her album of the week. Empire noted that the writing in Gold Record is more oriented on others, as compared to Shepherd in a Sheepskin Vest, which she described as personal and introspective. She writes, \"Continuing one of music\u2019s great about-turns, the undersung one-time misanthrope releases an album abundant in warmth and empathy.\" Mike Goldsmith of Record Collector similarly praised Callahan for his shifting attitudes. Goldsmith also expressed, \"While the album is intended as 10 individual slices of life, collective themes quickly emerge and turn it into more than the sum of its parts.\"\n\nIn a mixed review, Justin Vellucci of PopMatters suggested that the album has a sparse and very dry recording tone. According to Vellucci, one of the biggest shortcomings of Gold Record is that it \"makes the distance between Callahan's hangdog narration and the music that accompanies it all the more obvious and all the more a chasm.\" In a more positive review for AllMusic, Heather Phares claimed that \"Gold Record is especially satisfying for longtime fans as part of a bounty of great work from Callahan since his return, but there's plenty here to delight anyone who loves brilliant songwriting and down-to-earth performances.\"\n\nPersonnel\n\nCredits adapted from the album's liner notes.",

At the 2007 World Junior Curling Championships she played second for the Swiss team, skipped by Sandra Zurbuchen. The team wrapped up the round robin tournament with a 5\u20134 record, in a three-way tie for fourth place. The team had to play in two tie-break matches to make the playoffs.

  "Bluey and Curley\n\nBluey and Curley is an Australian newspaper comic strip written by the Australian artist, caricaturist, and cartoonist Alex Gurney.\n\nFew original Bluey and Curley strips are held in public collections, because Gurney often gave the original art work of his caricatures, cartoons, and comic strips to anyone who asked. Following Gurney's death in 1955, the strip was taken over by Norm Rice in early 1956, but he died in a vehicle accident that year. Bluey and Curley was then taken over by cartoonist Les Dixon who drew it for 18 years until he retired in 1975.\n\nCharacters\n\nThe first Bluey and Curley strip appeared soon after the start of World War II. It featured two Australian soldiers, Bluey (who had served in the First AIF), and Curley, a new recruit.\n\nBy the end of the war, they had served in every Australian campaign \u2014 in North Africa, in the Middle East, in New Guinea, in Northern Australia, and in the Pacific Islands \u2014 and, once the war was over, they even went to London and took part in the 1946 Victory Parade.\n\nCreation\n\nBy 1939, Alex Gurney was already well established as a caricaturist, cartoonist, and comic strip artist.\n\nIn late 1939, following the outbreak of World War II, he created his most famous characters, Bluey and Curley, which first appeared in the Picture-News magazine.\n\nHe applied for the copyright registration of Bluey and Curley on 16 October 1939; and his application was granted on 9 November 1939 (Australian Copyright No.6921).\n\nSyndication\n\nIt was transferred to The Sun News-Pictorial in 1940, from whence it was syndicated throughout Australia, New Zealand and Canada.\n\nCultural impact\n\nThe strip featured a pair of soldiers, \"Bluey\" (named for his red hair), the Great War veteran who had re-enlisted in the second A.I.F., and Curley (named for his extremely curly hair), the new recruit to the A.I.F.\n\nThe strip was widely appreciated for the good-humoured way it depicted the Australian \"diggers\" and their \"mateship\", as well as for its realistic use of Australian idiom of the day.\n\nService life\n\nGurney visited army camps throughout Australia and New Guinea to ensure authenticity. While in New Guinea he contracted malaria and was incapacitated for some time.\n\nPost-war life\n\nGurney was in England in June 1946, as part of an Australian Press Syndicate sent specifically to view the Victory Parade. As well as sending caricatures of various eminent people involved in that parade back to Australia for distribution through the press, he also used the opportunity to have Bluey and Curley attend the parade, and a number of his Bluey and Curley comic strips reflected that event.\n\nGurney's visit to London, and his version of events, as seen through his Bluey and Curley comic strip, was also historically significant for another reason: it was the first time that a newspaper comic strip had ever been transmitted from England to Australia by radio.\n\nAlthough Bluey and Curley were popular with Australians because they related to the slang, attitude, and the lack of respect towards authority exhibited by the main characters, the strip lost some of its appeal and readership when the pair returned to \"civvy street\".\n\nGurney's death\n\nGurney died suddenly, of heart disease, on 4 December 1955. He had collapsed in his car parked outside his home.\n\nPost-Gurney\n\nThe strip was later drawn by Norman Howard Rice (1911\u20131956). Rice died as the result of a car accident on 31 December 1956 (New Year's Eve). The strip was then drawn by Les Dixon from 1957 until 1975.\n\nFilm\n\nThe comic was adapted into a TV film Mud, Bloody Mud in 1985.",

  "Headborough\n\nIn English law, the term headborough, head-borough, borough-head, borrowhead, or chief pledge, referred historically to the head of the legal, administrative, and territorial unit known as a tithing, which sometimes, particularly in Kent, Surrey and Sussex, was known as a borgh, borow, or borough. The office was rendered in Latin documents as capitalis plegius (chief pledge) or decennarius (tenner).\n\nIn the Anglo-Saxon system of frankpledge, or frith-borh, the headborough presided over the borhsmen in his jurisdiction, who in turn presided over the local tithingmen. Frankpledge was a system that existed to create an incentive for a tithing to police itself, and consequently, the headborough was effectively obliged to police his tithing, as well as dealing with more administrative matters. By the early 16th century, the office had evolved into the position of parish constable, a parochial officer subordinate to a hundred-constable.\n\nAlthough the parish constable and hundred-constable share the term, the two roles had different functions, and origins. While the hundred-constable originated from senior military officers enforcing civil order, the parish constable had a wide range of civil administration functions in addition to a recognisable policing role. It is the hundred-constable which originated the term constable, and the parish constable acquired it by comparison; where the term headborough or chief pledge is used in contrast to a constable, the term constable is likely to refer specifically to the role of a hundred-constable.\n\nIn the sense of parish constable, the term is found in the induction to Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew (written c. 1590\u201392), when the Hostess of an alehouse, arguing with a drunken troublemaker, declares, \"I know my remedie, I must go fetch the Headborough\" (Induction, i); and again in Much Ado About Nothing (written c. 1598\u20139), where the dramatis personae describes Verges as a Headborough, subordinate to Constable Dogberry (Act 3, scene 5).",

  "Peregrina Mogas Fontcuberta\n\nPeregrina Mogas Fontcuberta (13 January 1827 - 3 July 1886) was a Spanish Roman Catholic nun in the name of \"Mar\u00eda Ana\" and the founder of the Franciscan Missionaries of the Mother of the Divine Shepherd. Mogas Fontcuberta was in a Capuchin congregation before establishing her own order and was under the guidance of Josep Tous Soler.\n\nThe beatification cause commenced under Pope Paul VI on 11 June 1977 and Pope John Paul II beatified her on 6 October 1996.\n\nLife\n\nPeregrina Mogas Fontcuberta was born in Granollers, a textile and farming city about thirty miles from Barcelona in Spain's Catalonia region on 13 January 1827. She was the third of four children of Lloren\u00e7 Mogas \u2013 a farmer and innkeeper \u2013 and Magdalena Fontcuberta. She was baptized mere hours after her birth and made her First Communion either at the age of six or seven. Her father died when she was seven and her mother only survived him by six years.\n\nAfter her parents died, her childless and widowed paternal aunt Dona Maria Mogas \u2013 who was also her godmother \u2013 raised Fontcuberta. The teenager joined many parish activities at Santa Maria del Mar, and the parish priest Mosen Gorgas became her confessor.\n\nDuring the political tumult in Barcelona in 1848, Fontcuberta met two nuns of the Capuchin congregation living together in a rented flat, and through them met Josep Tous Soler. The Bishop of Vic Luciano Casadevall had allowed them to open a school in Ripoll. Impressed by Father Soler's charisma as well, as their joint dedication to the path of Francis of Assisi, Fontcuberta decided to join the religious at the school, and left all she had to follow this calling.\n\nThus, in 1850, despite her confessor's concerns, Fontcuberta went to Ripoll, and was formally clothed in the habit of the Capuchins of the Divine Shepherdess. The school opened on 27 May 1850. Despite still being in the novitiate and lacking a formal teaching diploma, less than a month later (on 13 June 1850), Fontcuberta was named the school's superior and formally became such in September 1851. Nonetheless, she returned to the cloistered life in October 1851 to complete her novitiate. On 25 January 1851 she made her profession into the order. She received her teaching diploma in March 1853, then assumed her new religious name of \"Mar\u00eda Ana\" on 25 June.\n\nFontcuberta also met and discussed teaching with Antonio Maria Claret. On 10 December 1865 she accompanied four nuns to assist Antonia de Oviedo Sch\u00f6ntal with her new religious congregation. In 1868 Fontcubra led a group of religious to Spain's capital city, Madrid, where they founded a kindergarten. Despite political unrest (particularly after the assassination of the progressive Prime Minister Juan Prim in December 1870), the religious persisted in their mission to educate the city's poor and help the sick. Spain's Cardinal Archbishop of Toledo (the country's leading prelate) Cirilo de Alameda y Brea formally approved Fontcuberta's founding a new religious order, recognizing it on 16 January 1872 as the Franciscan Missionaries of the Mother of the Divine Shepherd.\n\nDeath and legacy\n\nFontcuberta died at midnight on 3 July 1886 due to increasing seizures which she had begun suffering in 1878, and which led her to retire to Fuencarral in May 1886.\n\nHer order grew and eventually pursued recognition for the foundress. Her order was aggregated with other Franciscan Orders on 19 June 1906. As of 2005, the order included 669 religious in 105 houses in locations as diverse as Benin, Argentina and Portugal.\n\nFontcubra received a papal decree of praise on 22 September 1894, and diocesan approval for her potential beatification came on 4 July 1896. Pope Leo XIII issued formal approval of the potential cause on 8 August 1899. Several sisters of the order were martyred for their faith and religious activities in 1936 during the Spanish Civil War. The informative process concerning Mogas Fontcubra commenced in Madrid on 5 March 1949 and concluded on 28 May 1963. Theologians examined all of her theological writings and declared that the latter complied with the magisterium of the faith, as an official decree declared on 21 October 1965.\n\nPope Paul VI declared Fontcuberta a Servant of God on 11 June 1977, after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints (C.C.S.) began the formal cause. A diocesan historical commission had begun an investigation which took from 1978 to 1988. Historians met on 9 May 1989 to approve the cause, and the C.C.S. validated their process on 1 December 1989. The C.C.S. received the Positio in 1990 and passed it onto consulting theologians on 3 June 1994 for their approval. The C.C.S. approved the cause on 18 October 1994. Pope John Paul II proclaimed M Fontcubra as Venerable on 15 December 1994 after confirming her life of heroic virtue.\n\nThe process of investigating a miracle spanned from 1989 until 1990 and received C.C.S. validation on 12 February 1993. A medical board approved the miracle on 14 June 1995, and theologians came to the same conclusion on 1 November 1995. After the C.C.S. voted in favor on 5 March 1996, Pope John Paul II approved the result on 25 June 1996 and beatified her on 6 October 1996.\n\nA church in Madrid is named to honor Maria Ana Mogas Fontcubra.",
  "Cellular repeater\n\nA cellular repeater (also known as cell phone signal booster or cell phone signal amplifier) is a type of bi-directional amplifier used to improve cell phone reception. A cellular repeater system commonly consists of a donor antenna that receives and transmits signal from nearby cell towers, coaxial cables, a signal amplifier, and an indoor rebroadcast antenna.\n\nDonor antenna\n\nA \"donor antenna\" is typically installed by a window or on the roof a building and used to communicate back to a nearby cell tower. A donor antenna can be any of several types, but is usually directional or omnidirectional. An omnidirectional antenna (which broadcast in all directions) is typically used for a repeater system that amplify coverage for all cellular carriers. A directional antenna is used when a particular tower or carrier needs to be isolated for improvement. The use of a highly directional antenna can help improve the donor's signal-to-noise ratio, thus improving the quality of signal redistributed inside a building.\n\nIndoor antenna\n\nSome cellular repeater systems can also include an omnidirectional antenna for rebroadcasting the signal indoors. Depending on attenuation from obstacles, the advantage of using an omnidirectional antenna is that the signal will be equally distributed in all directions.\n\nMotor vehicle antenna\n\nWhen it is raining & the motor vehicle windows are closed a cell phone could lose between %50 to %100 of its reception. To rectify the reception an antenna is placed outside the vehicle & is wired to the inside of the vehicle to another antenna & amplifier to transmit the mobile phone signal to the cell phone inside the vehicle.\n\nSignal amplifier\n\nCellular repeater systems include a signal amplifier. Standard GSM channel selective repeaters (operated by telecommunication operators for coverage of large areas and big buildings) have output power around 2 W, high power repeaters have output power around 10 W. The power gain is calculated by the following equation: A repeater needs to secure sufficient isolation between the donor and the service antenna. When the isolation is lower than actual gain plus a margin (of typically 5\u201315 dB), the repeater may go into in loop oscillation. This oscillation can cause interference to the cellular network.\n\nThe isolation may be improved by antenna type selection in a macro environment, which involves adjusting the angle between the donor and service antennas (ideally 180\u00b0), space separation (typically the vertical distance in the case of the tower installation between donor and service antenna is several meters), insertion into an attenuating environment (e.g. installing a metal mesh between donor and service antennas), and/or reduction of reflections (no near obstacles in front of the donor antenna such as trees or buildings).\n\nIsolation can be also improved by integrated feature called ICE (interference cancellation equipment) offered in some products (e.g., NodeG, RFWindow). Activation of this feature has a negative impact on internal delay (higher delay => approximately +5 \u03bcs up to standard rep. delay) and consequently a shorter radius from donor site. Amplification and filtering introduce a delay (typically between 5 and 15 \u03bcs), depending on the type of repeater and features used. Additional distance also adds propagation delay.\n\nRural areas\n\nIn many rural areas the housing density is too low to make construction of a new base station commercially viable. Installing a home cellular repeater may remedy this. In flat rural areas the signal is unlikely to suffer from multipath interference.\n\nBuilding construction material\n\nCertain construction materials can attenuate cell phone signal strength. Older buildings, such as churches, often block cellular signals. Any building that has a significant thickness of concrete, or a large amount of metal used in its construction, will attenuate the signal. Concrete floors are often poured onto a metal pan, which completely blocks most radio signals. Some solid foam insulation and some fiberglass insulation used in roofs or exterior walls have foil backing, which can reduce transmittance. Energy efficient windows and metal window screens are also very effective at blocking radio signals. Some materials have peaks in their absorption spectra, which decrease signal strength.\n\nBuilding size\n\nLarge buildings, such as warehouses, hospitals, and factories, often lack cellular reception. Low signal strength also tends to occur in underground areas (such as basements, and in shops and restaurants located towards the centre of shopping malls). In these cases, an external antenna is usually used.\n\nMultipath interference\n\nEven in urban areas (which usually have strong cellular signals throughout), there may be dead zones caused by destructive interference of waves. These usually have an area of a few blocks and will usually only affect one of the two frequency ranges used by cell phones. This happens because different wavelengths of the different frequencies interfere destructively at different points. Directional antennas can be helpful at overcoming this issue since they may be used to select a single path from several (see Multipath interference for more details).\n\nDiffraction and general attenuation\n\nThe longer wavelengths have the advantage of diffracting more, and so line of sight is not as necessary to obtain a good signal. Because the frequencies that cell phones use are too high to reflect off the ionosphere as shortwave radio waves do, cell phone waves cannot travel via the ionosphere. (See Diffraction and Attenuation for more details).\n\nDifferent operating frequencies\n\nRepeaters are available for all of the GSM frequency bands. Some repeaters will handle different types of networks (such as multi-mode GSM and UMTS). Repeater systems are available for certain Satellite phone systems, allowing these to be used indoors without a clear line of sight to the satellite.\n\nApproval in the USA by the FCC\n\nIt used to be legal to use the low power devices available for home and small scale use in commercial areas (offices, shops, bars, etc.).\n\nOn February 20, 2013, the FCC released a Report & Order, thus establishing two Safe Harbors and defining the use of \"network safe\" consumer boosters on licensed spectrum. The Safe Harbors represent a compromise solution between Technology Manufacturers and Wireless Operators. Only a few companies have a product compatible with the new FCC regulations.\n\nThe FCC has defined two types of repeaters:\n\nThese new rules by the FCC were implemented on March 1, 2014. Here are the rules.\n\nApproval in the UK by Ofcom and the UK market\n\nIn May 2011, Ofcom stated the following:\n\nInstallation or use of repeater devices (as with any radio equipment) is a criminal offence unless two conditions are satisfied:\n\nUnder WT Act 2006 section 1.15, the wireless act also allows an exemption if the device does not \"involve undue interference with wireless telegraphy\". This is expected to follow the US-style regulations where a mobile repeater must have protection built in against interference.\n\nOfcom stated that \"Repeater devices transmit or re-transmit in the cellular frequency bands. Only the mobile network operators are licensed to use equipment that transmits in these bands. Installation or use of repeater devices by anyone without a licence is a criminal offence under Section 8 of the WT Act 2006.\" Repeaters operating in rural and less densely populated areas do not pose a quantifiable problem.",
  "Book signing\n\nBook signing is the affixing of a signature to the title page or flyleaf of a book by its author. Book signings are events, usually at a bookstore or library, where an author sits and signs books for a period.\n\nBook signing\n\nBook signing is popular because an author's signature increases the value of books for collectors. The author may add a short message to the reader, called a dedication, to each book, which may be personalized with the recipient's name upon request. A simple author's signature without a dedication is typically more valuable to collectors (exceptions include inscriptions to persons of note, e.g., from Hemingway to Fitzgerald, or to persons of significance in the author's life).\n\nSometimes an author will sign additional copies for future sale. An additional advantage to authors for doing this is that once a book has been signed, it cannot be returned to the publisher for a refund.\n\nMany authors today spend a great deal of time signing their books, and sign many thousands of copies. For example, John Green signed all 150,000 copies of the first printing of his 2012 novel The Fault in Our Stars.\n\nThe growing popularity of ebooks and ereading devices has inspired the development of software - such as Authorgraph (formerly known as Kindlegraph and renamed to reflect its expansion to include all ereading platforms) and Autography (for iOS devices) - that allows authors to digitally personalize ebooks, by including autographs, dedications, and photographs, and to provide such personalization remotely as well as at in-person book signings. Such software benefits authors, \"who are not obliged to go on long distance promotional tours in order to autograph e-books for their fans\", as well as those readers who are unwilling or unable to brave crowds and longs lines at onsite book signings. Before such applications were introduced, efforts to bridge the digital divide for those who read ebooks included having authors sign the backs of their fan's ereading devices or sign ebooks via direct stylus input (e.g., on a Sony Reader Touch or Palm eReader).\n\nBook signings\n\nBook signings provide more than just a chance to obtain signatures. Authors and bookstores are benefited by the fact that many copies of the book being promoted are sold at these events. Signings also increase public goodwill and allow authors to connect with their fans. For fans, signings provide a chance to see and meet a favorite author and ask them questions.\n\nThe development of social media platforms allows modern day authors to conduct virtual book signings. For example, The GoodEReader and Autography jointly hosted an ebook signing with author HP Mallory, during which Mallory greeted fans via Spreecast, a social connectivity platform that allows users to have up to four guests on video chat at one time, to conduct Q&A sessions with even more participants, and to maintain a channel on the site, thereby recording and storing the Spreecast and assigning the recordings a URL for sharing at other outlets.\n\nMany authors use the book signing platform LiveSigning to host large-scale, streaming video book signings with their fans. Donald Trump hosted a book signing on this platform during his presidential campaign in December 2015. Book signings on LiveSigning typically consist of the author signing books, answering questions from fans, and making phone calls to some fans. After the event, the signed books are mailed to everyone who purchased a signed copy.",

  "Black Mennonites\n\nBlack Mennonites are people who are both Mennonite and Black. Black Mennonites live in Africa, the United States, Canada, and elsewhere. Black Mennonite communities have existed in the United States and Canada since the late 1800s. Ethiopia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo are home to the second and fourth largest populations of Mennonites in the world. Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Kenya, and Angola also have some of the larger populations of Mennonites in the world. Glen Alexander Guyton, the first African-American leader of the Mennonite Church USA, has stated that \"The typical Mennonite is an African woman\", due to Mennonite missionary outreach in Africa, and that African Mennonites \"are now sending missionaries to Europe and the United States.\" While Mennonites have historically been mostly white people of Central European or Eastern European descent, with population centers in North America and Europe, Black Mennonites now outnumber white Mennonites globally. African Mennonite churches have had a larger number of members than North American Mennonite churches since 2006.\n\nCanada\n\nIn 1882, Charles Jones became the first black member of the Ontario Mennonite Church taking the black-Mennonite relationship to the level of church membership.\n\nSouth Africa\n\nStanley Green, a South African Mennonite, was installed as the president of the Mennonite Board of Missions in 1994.

Rowena and James were husband and wife.\n\nVincent Harding, a prominent Black Mennonite and civil right activist, gave a speech at Woodlawn Mennonite Church in Chicago in 1959 during a seminar about race and racism. Harding was a professor at several universities, an author, and a speech writer for Martin Luther King Jr. Harding outlines three points of order during his speech promoting the necessity of racial unity within and outside of the Mennonite church: that \"problem of race\" should be defined as a moral and spiritual problem, that white Mennonites should confess the \"sins of irresponsibility\" that had plagued previous attempts at racial dialogue within Mennonite communities, and making Mennonites \"near the heat of the battle\" by making themselves visible in anti-racist struggles.\n\nThe Black Caucus of the (old) Mennonite Church was formed in 1971.\n\nBetween 1950 and 1980, the number of Black Mennonites in the United States increased to 1,600 members in 49 Black and integrated churches.\n\nJoy Lovett was elected as the first Black associate general secretary of the Mennonite Church in 1983.\n\nBetween 1985 and 1995, the Mennonite Church engaged in a concerted effort to reach out to urban communities.

  "Wyalkatchem, Western Australia\n\nWyalkatchem is a town in the central Wheatbelt region, 192 km east-north-east of Perth, 35 km east of Dowerin and 44 km south of Koorda. At the, Wyalkatchem had a population of 358.\n\nThe town won the state tidy town award in 2000 and 2002, and then won the national award in 2003.\n\nHistory\n\nWyalkatchem is an Aboriginal name first recorded for a waterhole spelt Walkatching in the 1870s. The spelling Walcatching was used in 1881 when the Toodyay Road Board referred to a tank to be built there, and when the road from Northam to the Yilgarn Goldfield was surveyed in 1892 the spelling Wyalcatchem was used for the tank. The Walkatching spelling is probably the most accurate, as Aboriginal names in this region rarely end in em. The change of spelling from Wyalcatchem to Wyalkatchem in 1911 was done by the Department of Lands & Surveys according to rules the department had adopted for spelling Aboriginal names. The meaning of the name is not known.\n\nIn 1932 the Wheat Pool of Western Australia announced that the town would have two grain elevators, each fitted with an engine, installed at the railway siding.\n\nWhen the extension of the railway east from Dowerin was planned in 1908 land was set aside for a future townsite in the area of the Wyalcatchem tank. The route of the railway and site for a station was not fixed until 1910, and action followed to then fix the position of the townsite and survey town lots. Following the survey of the lots the townsite was gazetted spelt Wyalkatchem in 1911.\n\nWhen the railway from Dowerin opened in February 1911, Wyalkatchem was a minor siding only, but its importance grew when it was selected as the turnout point for a branch line leading north and then east to the Mount Marshall district. Thus a small village quickly blossomed on the town site. The branch line to Bencubbin opened on 1 February 1915 and the line from Dowerin was extended to Merredin in August 1911.\n\nA bioblitz was conducted in 2012 in a bush reserve between Korrelocking and Wyalkatchem. 54 people took part and collected samples of scorpions, pseudoscorpions, isopods, spiders and centipedes, including some new species.\n\nCommercial area\n\nThe extensive railway barracks in town are leased by the shire council from the Western Australian Government Railways Commission. The barracks represent one of the few intact examples of its kind in Australia and are currently used as accommodation during Dowerin Field Days and as the headquarters of a hang-gliding club.\n\nThe area is home to a Cooperative Bulk Handling receival point that can hold nearly 120,000 tonnes of grain and crops; the primary industries in the area are wheat and sheep farming. The town also supports a gypsum mine that is situated just outside town at Lake Cowcowing.\n\nIn 2013 Wyalkatchem hosted the inaugural Racewars event, organised by The Racewars Group. The event saw 200 competitors and over 3000 spectators witness some of Western Australia's fastest vehicles race head-to-head and against the clock on the 1500m airstrip at the Wyalkatchem airport. After the success of the inaugural event, Wyalkatchem has agreed to host the event for another five years.",

In 1933 she was appointed director of curriculum for the Department of Education, a position she held for six years. In 1934 she was appointed president of the Arizona Parent-Teacher Association.\n\nIn 1926 Boehringer was legislative chairman for the Arizona Federation of Women's Clubs. In 1919, she organized and was the first state president of the Arizona Federation of Business and Professional Women's clubs in 1921 and served a second term as state president in 1924. In both positions, she helped working women to network and advocated for equal pay and education.\n\nBoehringer was involved in many other organizations:\n\nPersonal life\n\nIn 1912 C. Louise Boehringer moved to Yuma, Arizona, joining her brother, George, and parents who had moved there in 1909, claiming a 40-acre ranch and establishing a dairy farm.\n\nWhen in 1940 Boehringer lost for the third time in the run for State Superintendent of Public Instruction, she retired from public life and in 1953 she moved to Washington with her sister-in-law.\n\nShe died in Seattle on September 11, 1956, and is buried at Evergreen Washelli Memorial Park, Seattle.",

  "Washington State Route 704\n\nState Route 704 (known as SR 704 or the Cross-Base Highway) is a state highway located entirely in Pierce County, Washington, United States. It is intended to provide access between Interstate 5 (I-5) and SR 7 by passing through a portion of Joint Base Lewis\u2013McChord, a major U.S. military installation. The designated route comprises a short, 0.6 mi section near SR 7 in Spanaway. The full 6 mi highway is estimated to cost $480 million to construct, but remains unfunded.\n\nRoute description\n\nThe legislative definition of SR 704 begins at I-5 near Lakewood on the northwest side of Joint Base Lewis\u2013McChord, a U.S. military installation. The signed portion of the highway begins at milepost 5.92, an intersection with Spanaway Loop Road south of Spanaway Lake. The highway travels east for 0.63 mi between Joint Base Lewis\u2013McChord and a residential neighborhood to its eastern terminus, an intersection with SR 7 at 176th Street East. The signed section of SR 704 is wholly contained within the unincorporated community of Spanaway in southern Pierce County.\n\nThe signed portion of SR 704 is a divided highway with five lanes\u2014three eastbound and two westbound\u2014separated by a median barrier. It is maintained by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), which conducts an annual survey of traffic volume that is expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic. The lone counting station on SR 704, at Spanaway Lake Road, measured an average of 22,000 vehicles using the highway in 2016.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Pierce County government proposed the construction of a new highway connecting I-5 to SR 7 south of McChord Air Force Base in the late 1980s to address congestion on nearby highways. The route would follow the perimeter between McChord Air Force Base and neighboring Fort Lewis, terminating at Thorne Lake in Tillicum in the west and Spanaway in the east. The proposal, dubbed the Cross-Base Highway, was forwarded to the state government, U.S. Army, and U.S. Air Force for consideration. The county government studied eight routes for the highway and eliminated four in 1992 after being unable to reduce impacts to the Fort Lewis Logistics Center. The remaining options were determined to have adverse affects on American Lake Gardens, a residential neighborhood near the Thorne Lake interchange, generating protests.\n\nIn 2002, the state legislature assigned SR 704 to the Cross-Base Highway and earmarked part of the $127 million in funding needed for the project. The Federal Highway Administration issued a record of decision that approved the project in 2004, allowing for land acquisition and engineering to begin. The project remained opposed by environmental and conservation groups seeking to limit urban sprawl and the encroachment on the habitats of endangered species.\n\nEnvironmental lawsuit\n\nIn July 2010, a coalition of local businesses, conservation organizations, and equestrian clubs filed a lawsuit against the Federal Highway Administration, WSDOT, and Pierce County to prevent construction of the proposed highway. Because the project has no funding and thus no construction schedule, the parties agreed to a stay of proceedings on October 15.\n\nThe coalition contended that the agencies failed to follow the Endangered Species Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, and failed to adequately consider reasonable alternatives. The coalition reports that the proposed highway would bisect the largest remnant oak woodland-prairie left in the Puget Sound area. The US Fish and Wildlife Service describes the area as \"possibly the rarest habitat in North America,\" home to at least 29 species of federal and/or state threatened, endangered, candidate, and sensitive plant and animal species of concern, 18 of which are in the immediate vicinity of the proposed highway.\n\nDrawing comparisons with Mt. Rainier National Park and Nisqually National Wildlife Area, Pierce County's Biodiversity Network Assessment describes the area as \"the most biologically and ecologically rich area remaining in the lower elevations of Pierce County.\" The County predicts that these diverse habitats support 20 state or federally listed species, 24 Priority Habitat and Species, and 10 at-risk species, and dozens of other plants and animals.\n\nThe project's Environmental Impact Statement states, None of the areas affected by the project are quality prairie habitat; most of the grasslands are non-native. The alignment was purposely placed to avoid wetlands. The Douglas-fir forest habitat is all second-growth; most is in even-aged stands with little structural diversity and is considered to be invasive to oak woodland and prairie habitats. The grassland habitats with some native prairie species intersected by the proposed alignment occur at two locations. The first is a mowed field with few native plants west of Lake Mondress that is also heavily used as a practice arena by equestrian enthusiasts. The second location is southeast of Lake Mondress, where the alignment skirts the northern edge of a prairie habitat mostly invaded by Scot's broom. The intersection point is at a disturbed railway junction. Both locations support prairie habitat. The remaining areas are disturbed fields dominated by weedy Scot's broom. In summary, the project does not affect grasslands or prairie of the type referred to in this comment.\n\nThe EIS also states that \"By 2025, most of the freeway and arterial street systems will operate at [Level of Service] F conditions with volume/capacity (V/C) ratios well above 1.0.\" This means very heavy congestion and gridlock during most of the day.\n\nFurthermore, the proposed highway will increase climate impacts by increasing driving distance. The EIS states that \"Overall, people would travel a little farther to use the new Cross-Base Highway project to avoid other congested highways and arterials; this would increase miles driven.\"\n\nA contrary view was expressed by Pierce County Executive John Ladenburg, who believes that it would be \"environmentally irresponsible not to build that highway,\" because SR 704 will lessen development in the Puyallup Valley farmlands.\n\nConstruction and cancellation\n\nThe Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) planned to extend the highway to be 6 mi long, originating at Interstate 5 in the Tillicum neighborhood of Lakewood, Washington. A four-lane, divided highway with four intersections over its entire length, SR 704 may improve access to and between the military installations by providing an exclusive roadway between Fort Lewis and McChord AFB. It could also connect the developing industrial areas of DuPont and Frederickson as well as provide an east\u2013west alternate thoroughfare to overcrowded SR 512.\n\nAfter voters rejected a November 2007 ballot measure which would fund the construction, most of the project was put on hold. However, on June 20, 2008, the WSDOT awarded a $7.35 million contract to Ceccanti Inc. for widening of the eastern 0.7 mi of the route between Spanaway Loop Road and State Route 7. Groundbreaking was July 30, 2008. Assistant Project Engineer John Ho says that the project was scheduled to be completed by 2017 at the earliest. As of 2018, the project remains on hold until further action is taken by the state legislature.\n\nThe WSDOT puts the 2007 price tag for the highway at $480 million. However, only $43 million has been funded, requiring at least $437 million. Of this gap, only $50 million had been expected to be funded by a failed 2007 ballot initiative which in the end did not include the project.\n\nIn August 2017, the Federal Highway Administration rescinded its record of decision for the project, which had been issued in 2004.",

  "Nano Ganesh\n\nNano Ganesh is an irrigation automation system from Indian company which allows farmers to use mobile phones to remotely control the irrigation pumps located in distant hazardous locations. It is a hardware device attached to the existing starter and water pump set. The application was developed by Ossian Agro Automation in Pune, India, initially with external basic mobile phones used for wireless connectivity and later on with built-in GSM modules named as Nano Ganesh GSM. The overall developments of various wireless remote controllers began in 1996 by Santosh Ostwal, an Electrical Engineer, the founder of Ossian and son of a farmer. Approximately 60,000 farmers in India have been using Nano Ganesh since 2008 till 2017. In mid-2009, it was tested in Anand district in the Indian state of Gujarat in partnership with Tata Teleservices using Tata phones. Later, it was designed to operate on any basic mobile phones. In 2014, Ossian further upgraded the technology as Nano Ganesh M2M to monitor the water level of overhead water tanks on mobile phones and remotely control the water pump as per the lower and overflow levels of water in the tanks.\n\nUsage\n\nIn some parts of India, farmers have to walk several kilometers to turn on the irrigation pumps that water their fields. With the electrical supply often erratic, they sometimes find that there is no electricity when they reach the pump. Nano Ganesh allows them to remotely check the availability of electricity, and to remotely turn the pump on and off, all through a mobile phone. It helps the farmers to easily access the remote water pumps avoiding exhaustive long travel over difficult terrain, bad weather, and hazardous locations. It also means growers don't have to wake up in the middle of the night, which is often the time electricity is available, to walk the long distances to their fields. They sometimes hire workers to walk the long distances to turn the pumps on and off.\n\nTechnical specifications\n\nThe application comprises an electronic hardware (modem) with a basic mobile connection and an external feature phone, that attaches to the starter on the irrigation pump (Latest models do not need external mobile phones). Using the regular mobile phone, the farmer can switch on or off the water pump by text message or active calling with an assigned code number for on and off, and acknowledges the status of the power or pump by a particular tone signals as well as text messages. Another version of Nano Ganesh is M2M based in which preset water levels in the overhead tanks are sensed by the magnetic float sensors whose signals are passed to the GSM based Nano Ganesh transmitter which sends the wireless commands of water levels to be displayed on the mobile phone. This allows the water operator to avoid climbing up the dangerous steps of risky overhead tanks for checking water levels and also avoid travels to the distant pumps. This helps to efficiently control the water pump to avoid overflowing of the water. Another Nano Ganesh modem is also available to alert the owner on mobile phone when there is a theft attempt of the modem, cable, or the pump itself.\n\nAwards and recognition\n\nNano Ganesh application was a Grand Prize winner in Nokia's Calling All Innovators contest in emerging market category, which awards new mobile applications designed to improve quality of life. Nano Ganesh was nominee for the Global Mobile Awards announced by GSMA, London for the best mobile application in the world in Social-Economic category. Nano Ganesh has been a winner of DST Lockheed-Martin IIGP 2011 program. Nano Ganesh has been selected for recognition as a laureate in the Economic Development category for 2011, by The Tech Awards at the Tech Museum at San Jose, CA, USA.\n\nIn 2015, Food and Agriculture Organization of United Nations (UNFAO) featured Nano Ganesh as one of the seven successful Information and Communication Tools for agriculture and rural developments. In 2017, Nano Ganesh was lively demonstrated in the Innovation City in M4D section of Mobile World Congress organized by GSMA at Barcelona, Spain. UNESCO-Pearson published the case story of Nano Ganesh as one of the 14 digital initiatives developed for empowering the low income population.",
  "Bartlett High School (Alaska)\n\nBartlett High School is a high school in Anchorage, Alaska. It had an enrollment of 1,666 as of November 26, 2016. Construction started in 1971, and the first classes were held in 1973. The school originally housed both Bartlett High School, named after U.S. Senator Bob Bartlett, and Begich Junior High School, named after U.S. Representative Nick Begich.\n\nBartlett is part of the Anchorage School District and is accredited by the Northwest Association of Schools and Colleges. Its attendance area is northeast Anchorage and Elmendorf Air Force Base, and approximately 25% of its students are military dependents. The student body is racially and ethnically diverse. About 43.7% of the students are white, 18.9% are black, 6.1% are Hispanic, 13.5% are Asian/Pacific Islander, and 17.8% are American Indian/Alaska Native.\n\nThe school district's 2003-2004 Profile of Performance reported three goals: \"Improve school climate\" (attained), \"increase percentage of students passing HSGQE Math by 5%\" (partially attained) and \"reduce dropout rate\" (attained). The dropout rate in 2003-4 was 7.3%.\n\nBartlett is classified as a 4A school by the Alaska School Activities Association.\n\nHistory\n\nBartlett High School was designed by architects CCC/HOK Architects and Planners and Manley & Mayer of Anchorage.\n\nBartlett High School was heavily damaged during the 7.0 earthquake that occurred on November 30, 2018.\n\nName of school\n\nLike other senior-junior school complexes in the Anchorage School District during the 1960s to the early 1970s, the complex housing Bartlett was originally given two names. One was for the senior high school, and the other for the junior high school. In line with this, the complex housing Bartlett was called Bartlett-Begich, denoting Bartlett High School (named after Sen. Bob Bartlett) and Begich Junior High School (named after Rep. Nick Begich). During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Anchorage School Board began to change all of these complexes into high schools and to create separate junior high schools (now known as middle schools) as new facilities could be constructed, in each case moving the original junior high school name as the new junior high school was built. Hence, the complexes formerly known as Chugiak-Gruening became Chugiak High School and Gruening Middle School, Service-Hanshew became Service High School and Hanshew Middle School, and so on.\n\nAt the time the school now named Benny Benson Secondary School (an alternative school originally paired as a junior high with East High School, opened in 1991 ) was designed and built, it was not anticipated that a junior high school in the northeast Anchorage area would be built. The family of Nick Begich was asked if they would like the new facility named after Begich (rather than Benny Benson), but the family asked rather that the Begich's name remain on the Bartlett High School building until a new junior high could be built in the area, with the assumption that Begich's name would be transferred to that school. Thereafter, \"Bartlett-Begich\" remained technically associated with the school building, but Begich's name was not used on Bartlett High School diplomas, in official documents, or in Anchorage School District communications regarding the school; it was retained only in the words \"Bartlett - Begich\" painted on the southeast wall of the high school building.\n\nIn November 2006, the Anchorage School Board made official that the name of a new middle school in Anchorage would be named after Begich. Begich Middle School opened for classes on August 22, 2007.",
  "Apex (radio band)\n\nApex radio stations (also known as skyscraper and pinnacle) was the name commonly given to a short-lived group of United States broadcasting stations, which were used to evaluate transmitting on frequencies that were much higher than the ones used by standard amplitude modulation (AM) and shortwave stations. Their name came from the tall height of their transmitter antennas, which were needed because coverage was primarily limited to local line-of-sight distances. These stations were assigned to what at the time were described as \"ultra-high shortwave\" frequencies, between roughly 25 and 44 MHz. They employed amplitude modulation (AM) transmissions, although in most cases using a wider bandwidth than standard broadcast band AM stations, in order to provide high fidelity sound with less static and distortion.\n\nIn 1937 the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) formally allocated an Apex station band, consisting of 75 transmitting frequencies running from 41.02 to 43.98 MHz. These stations were never given permission to operate commercially, although they were allowed to retransmit programming from standard AM stations. Most operated under experimental licenses, however this band was the first to include a formal \"non-commercial educational\" station classification.\n\nThe FCC eventually concluded that frequency modulation (FM) transmissions were superior, and the Apex band was eliminated effective January 1, 1941, in order to make way for the creation of the original FM band, assigned to 42 to 50 MHz.\n\nInitial development\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, radio engineers and government regulators investigated the characteristics of transmitting frequencies higher than those currently in use. In the United States, by 1930 the original AM broadcasting band consisted of 96 frequencies from 550 to 1500 kHz, with a 10 kHz spacing between adjacent assignments. On this band, a station's coverage during the daytime consisted exclusively of its groundwave signal, which for the most powerful stations might exceed 200 miles (320 kilometers), although it was significantly less for the average station. However, during the nighttime, changes in the ionosphere resulted in additional long distance skywave signals, that were commonly reflected for up to hundreds of kilometers.\n\nOver time, technology was developed to transmit on progressively higher frequencies. (Although initially these were in general called \"ultra-high shortwave\" frequencies, radio spectrum nomenclature was later standardized, with 3 to 30 MHz transmissions becoming known as \"High Frequency\" (HF), 30 to 300 MHz called \"Very High Frequency\" (VHF), and 300 to 3,000 MHz called \"Ultra High Frequency\" (UHF)). It soon became apparent that there were significant differences in the propagation characteristics of various frequency ranges. Signals from shortwave stations, operating roughly in the range from 5 MHz to 20 MHz, were found to be readily reflected by the ionosphere during both the day and at night, resulting in stations that sometimes could transmit halfway around the world.\n\nInvestigations of increasingly higher frequencies found that, above around 20 MHz, signal propagation by both groundwave and skywave generally became minimal, which meant that station coverage now began to be limited to just line-of-sight distances from the transmitting antenna. This was considered to be a valuable characteristic by the FCC, because it would allow the establishment of broadcasting stations with limited but consistent day and night coverage, that could only be received by their local communities. It also meant that multiple stations could operate on the same frequency throughout the country without interfering with each other.\n\nBecause the standard AM broadcast band was considered to be too full to allow any meaningful increase in the number of stations, the FCC began to issue licenses to parties interested in testing the suitability of higher frequencies. Most Apex stations operated under experimental licenses, and were commonly affiliated with and subsidized by a commercially licensed AM station. Until the late 1930s, commercially made radio receivers did not cover these high frequencies, so early Apex station listeners constructed their own receivers, or built converters for existing models.\n\nOn March 18, 1934, W8XH in Buffalo, New York, a companion station to AM station WBEN, became the first Apex station to air a regular schedule. Although most of these stations merely retransmitted the programs of their AM station partners, in a few cases efforts were made to provide original programming. In 1936, The Milwaukee Journal's W9XAZ, which initially had relayed the programming of WTMJ, became the first Apex station to originate its own programming on a regular basis.\n\nWhile monitoring the first group of stations, it was soon realized that, due to the strengthening of the ionosphere during periods of high solar activity, at times the lower end of the VHF frequencies would produce strong, and undesirable, skywave signals. (The December 1937 issue of All-Wave Radio reported that W6XKG in Los Angeles, transmitting on 25.95 MHz, had been heard in both Asia and Europe, while W9XAZ, 26.4 MHz in Milwaukee, Wisconsin had \"a strong signal in Australia\", and W8XAI, 31.6 MHz in Rochester, New York, \"is another station that is often heard in Australia.\") This most commonly occurred during the summer months, and during peaks in the 11-year sunspot cycle. This determination led to the FCC moving the developing broadcasting service stations, which by now began to include experimental FM radio and TV stations, to higher frequencies that were less affected by solar influences.\n\nApex band establishment (1937)\n\nIn October 1937, the FCC announced a sweeping allocation of frequency assignments for the various competing services, including television, relay, and public service, which covered 10 kHz to 300 MHz. Included was a band of Apex stations, consisting of 75 channels with 40 kHz separations, and spanning from 41.02 to 43.98 MHz. The 40 kHz spacing between adjacent frequencies was four times as much as the 10 kHz spacing on the standard AM broadcast band, which reduced adjacent-frequency interference, and provided more bandwidth for high-fidelity programming.\n\nAt the time it was estimated that there were about 50 Apex-style stations currently in operation, although transmitting on a variety of frequencies. In January 1938 the band's first 25 channels, from 41.02 to 41.98 MHz, were reserved for non-commercial educational stations, with the Cleveland City Board of Education's WBOE in Cleveland, Ohio, the first station to begin operation within this group.\n\nConversion to FM (1941)\n\nAt the time the Apex band was established, the FCC noted that \"The Commission at an early date will consider carefully the needs and requirements for high-frequency broadcast stations using both conventional [AM] modulation and frequency modulation\". As of January 15, 1940, only 2 non-commercial and 14 experimental stations held Apex band licenses, all of which were assigned operating frequencies in the bottom half of the band. (A similar number of experimental stations held grants for frequencies in the 25-26 MHz region.) In addition, at this same time 20 experimental FM stations had been assigned slots within the top half of the Apex band frequencies.\n\nThe commission's studies soon found significant advantages to FM transmissions over the Apex AM signals. Sound quality, and especially resistance to interference from static, including from lightning, was found to be far superior for FM. Although FM assignments required five times the bandwidth of Apex stations (200 kHz vs. 40 kHz), the \"capture effect\" allowed FM stations operating on the same frequency to be spaced closer together than Apex stations. By 1939 the FCC began encouraging Apex stations to consider changing to the technically superior FM transmissions. In May 1940, the FCC decided to authorize a commercial FM band effective January 1, 1941, operating on 40 channels spanning 42\u201350 MHz. (This was later changed to 88\u2013106 MHz, and still later to 88\u2013108 MHz, which increased the number of channels to 100.)\n\nThis new assignment also resulted in the elimination of the Apex band, and the Apex stations were informed that they needed to either go silent or convert to FM. With this change, a few of the original Apex stations were converted into some of the earliest FM stations. The three educational stations were allowed some leeway in making the conversion to FM, with WBOE switching over in February 1941, WNYE receiving permission to continue as an Apex station until June 29, 1941, and WBKY receiving a series of authorizations to continue using its AM transmitter until May 1, 1944. Currently, the frequencies that had been used by the Apex band are allocated for land mobile communication.\n\nThere would be at least one attempt to revive the Apex band concept. Beginning in May 1946, consulting radio engineer Sarkes Tarzian operated a 200-watt experimental AM station, W9XHZ, on 87.75 MHz in Bloomington, Indiana. After two years of successful operation of what he referred to as his \"HIFAM\" station, in 1948 he proposed that the FCC allocate a small high-frequency broadcast band, 400 kHz wide with 10 kHz spacing between frequency assignments. Tarzian promoted this as a low-cost alternative to expensive FM transmitters and receivers, saying that a $5.95 converter could be added to existing AM radios that would allow them to pick up the HIFAM stations. He continued to operate his experimental station, which eventually became KS2XAP, until 1950, although by then its transmitting hours were greatly restricted, as the FCC required the station to remain off the air whenever nearby WFBM-TV in Indianapolis was broadcasting. This was due to the fact that the TV station's audio transmitter used the same frequency as Tarzian's station. Moreover, after his station's final license expired on June 1, 1950, the FCC denied Tarzian any further renewals, concluding it would not reverse its earlier determination that there was no need for a second AM broadcast band.",
  "Muscle Shoals Sound Studio\n\nMuscle Shoals Sound Studio is an American recording studio in Sheffield, Alabama, formed in 1969 by four session musicians known as The Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section. They had left nearby FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals to create their own recording facility.\n\nThey attracted noted artists from across the United States and Great Britain. Over the years, artists who recorded at Muscle Shoals Sound Studio included The Rolling Stones, Aretha Franklin, George Michael, Wilson Pickett, Willie Nelson, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Joe Cocker, Levon Helm, Paul Simon, Bob Seger, Rod Stewart, Tamiko Jones, Cher and Cat Stevens.\n\nFounders\n\nThe four founders of the studio, Barry Beckett, Roger Hawkins, Jimmy Johnson and David Hood, were session musicians at Rick Hall's FAME Studios; they were officially known as the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section but widely referred to as \"The Swampers,\" who were recognized as having crafted the \"Muscle Shoals sound\" in conjunction with Hall.\n\nThe Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section was the first group of musicians to own a studio and to eventually run their own publishing and production companies. They provided musical backing and arrangements for many recordings, including major hits by Wilson Pickett, Aretha Franklin, and the Staple Singers; a wide range of artists in popular music also recorded hit songs and complete albums at the studio. They had first worked together in 1967 and initially played sessions in New York and Nashville before doing so at FAME. Their initial successes in soul and R&B led to more mainstream rock and pop performers who began coming to record at Muscle Shoals Sound Studios, including the Rolling Stones, Traffic, Bob Seger, Elton John, Boz Scaggs, Willie Nelson, Paul Simon, Bob Dylan, Dr. Hook, Elkie Brooks, Millie Jackson, Julian Lennon, and Glenn Frey.\n\n3614 Jackson Highway\n\nThe Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section partnered with Jerry Wexler, who provided start-up funding to found Muscle Shoals Sound Studio at 3614 Jackson Highway in Sheffield. The concrete block building, originally built around 1946, was previously a coffin showroom.\n\nCher's sixth album was titled 3614 Jackson Highway (1969) and this became the informal name for the studio in 1969.\n\nThe first hit to the studio's credit was R. B. Greaves' \"Take a Letter Maria\". By December 1969, the Rolling Stones were recording at this new location for three days.\n\n1000 Alabama Avenue\n\nThe studio at 3614 Jackson Highway closed in April 1979, relocating to a larger updated facility in Sheffield located at 1000 Alabama Avenue. This location operated until it was closed and sold in 1985 to Malaco Records, Tommy Couch's Jackson, Mississippi-based soul and blues label, which also bought the publishing rights held by the Muscle Shoals Sound. Malaco used the Sheffield studios for its own artists, including Johnnie Taylor, Bobby Bland and Little Milton, as while continuing to operate its own facility in Jackson. The Rhythm Section, minus Beckett, worked with other studio musicians at Malaco Records and at other studios. In 2005, Couch decided to close the Malaco studio on Alabama Avenue because he was having difficulty competing with more technologically advanced studios.\n\nAfter the closure of the 1000 Alabama Avenue location, the building was taken over by a movie production company. In 2007, this location housed Cypress Moon Productions and the Cypress Moon Studio with functioning recording equipment, which was operating as a recording studio and was open for tours.\n\nRecent history\n\nAlthough it was no longer a working studio in 2009 and 2010, the Jackson Highway location was rented for recording some or all of two Grammy-nominated albums. Band of Horses's third CD, Infinite Arms, recorded in part at that studio, was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category Best Alternative Album.\n\nTen tracks of Black Keys's sixth album, Brothers, were also recorded at 3614 Jackson Highway. The album was nominated for a 2011 Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album. Two songs from the album, \"Tighten Up\" and \"Black Mud\", were nominated for Grammys: \"Tighten Up\" for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and Best Rock Song and \"Black Mud\" for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. Rolling Stone magazine placed the album at number-2 on its list of the Best Albums of 2010 and \"Everlasting Light\" at number 11 on its list of the Best Singles of 2010. The album was also featured on Spin magazine's Top 40 Albums of 2010.\n\nChris Stapleton recorded his Grammy winning single, \"Cold\" at Muscle Shoals Sound Studio in December of 2018 and received the Grammy in 2022 thus making the studio one that produces Grammy winning hit records once again.\n\nRestoration and reopening\n\nThe original studio building on Jackson Highway, which had become an audio visual retailer and then an appliance store until 1999, changed ownership, the subsequent owner completing some renovations and retaining the old recording equipment, allowing for tours of the property. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in June 2006.\n\nIn 2013, the documentary Muscle Shoals raised public interest in a major restoration of the studio, and in June that year, the owner sold the property (without the historic recording equipment) to the Muscle Shoals Music Foundation, an organization that had been formed earlier that year with the goal of establishing a music museum in the historic building. A large grant from Beats Electronics provided an essential $1 million. The state tourism director said that the 2013 Muscle Shoals film had significant influence. \"The financial support from Beats is a direct result of their film.\" Additional donations were made by other groups and individuals.\n\nThe building closed when major restoration work began in September 2015, and reopened as a finished tourist attraction operated by the Muscle Shoals Music Foundation on January 9, 2017. The interior is reminiscent of the 1970s, with relevant recording equipment and paraphernalia. According to a journalist who was a recent visitor, the restored studio is impressive: \"Muscle Shoals Sound's interior appears much as it did in its prime.... Some guitars and amps. A Hammond organ, Wurlitzer electric piano and black baby grand. The control room with recording console and analog tape machine... There are isolation booths, for vocals, percussion and such...\"\n\nThe Alabama Tourism Department named Muscle Shoals Sound Studio as the state's top attraction in 2017, even before the Jackson Highway studio reopened. Over 62,000 people from 50 countries and every state in the U.S. have visited since it opened for tours again in 2013.\n\nThe studio is a working recording studio at night. Dan Auerbach of the Black Keys recorded a solo project in March 2017. Grammy winning producer Dave Cobb of Nashville recorded rockers Rival Sons in April 2017. Actor Kiefer Sutherland recorded with Swamper David Hood in May 2017. In 2018, Bishop Gunn released the first recording from the studio after the restoration, \"Shine\" from their album, Natchez. Donnie Fritts released tunes recorded at the studio on his June album, in conjunction with John Paul White and Single Lock Records.\n\nDocumentary\n\nFilmmaker Greg Camalier premiered his documentary film Muscle Shoals at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2013. It is about Muscle Shoals sound, and features Rick Hall, FAME Studios, and the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section (Swampers) who had founded the Muscle Shoals Sound Studios. The film includes interviews with Percy Sledge, Wilson Pickett, Aretha Franklin, Etta James, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Steve Winwood, Bono, Alicia Keys and many others.",

  "Lollobrigida Girls\n\nLollobrigida girls, also known as VIS Lollobrigida  (VIS is a Croatian language acronym for'singing and instrument playing band', used often in the 1970s) or Lollobrigida is originally a Croatian, Zagreb\u2013based, female electro-pop/synthpop band. In 2008. The Slovenes Kleemar, David, and Jernej joined the band rendering the group Croatian-Slovenian in its composition.\n\nEarly history\n\nAs a duo, Lollobrigida performed for the first time at a bigger public concert in June 2003 in the student club KSET, as an opening band for German trash-style musician Mambo Kurt, attracting immediately a pronounced interest within Zagreb's underground-music audience.\n\nIn the original lineup there were Ida Prester and Natalija Dimicevski singing and playing bass-guitar on top of their computer-generated music matrix. In February 2004 the duo performed as a sole band at the crowded concert in Zagreb's Studentski centar; after that they signed a contract with the Slovenian label Menart Records/DOP Records.\n\nIn June 2004 Lollobrigida performed at the third Zagreb Pride.\n\nLollobrigida's first single, \"Party\", was released in September 2004 soon becoming a pretty well-accepted hit, rendering the underground phenomenon into a name known to many, first in Croatia and latter on in the neighboring countries. Sizeable covering in Croatian media, involving print, radio, and television, release of an anti-holiday single \"Unhappy Christmas\", and a performance at the big rock-concert Fiju Briju in Zagreb all enabled Lollobrigida to keep a high level of interest in the audience till the release of their debut album Cartoon Explosion, in May 2005. The girls have promoted the album in the club KSET again. The introductory band at the latter concert was a hip-hop duo Bitcharke na travi from Serbia, Beograd.\n\nVIS Lollobrigida\n\nIn 2006 Lollobrigida transformed to some extent their musical and stage-performing concept. Natalija left the band. Several instrumentalists, playing keyboards, guitar and bass, joined the band adding a new sound quality to the electronic matrix background. Unlike Ida, the band founder and the Lollobrigida constant, other band members were changing rather frequently. The prefix VIS has been also added to the band name. (A sort of sentimental homage to pop-rock music of socialistic times). During that year Lollobrigida started working on their new album, 'Lollobrigida Incorporated', finally released in May 2008, following the promo-concert taken place in Zagreb club Tvornica. In 2005 the single 'Bubblegum boy' was released. Soon after, the accompanied video spot was broadcast by MTV Adria and many other local TV-networks. In 2006 the band increased its popularity by releasing the single and video spot 'Moj decko je gay' (meaning 'My boyfriend is gay'). In 2008, a few months before a release of the new album, the single (and a video-spot) 'Miss Right and Mrs. Wrong' was launched, reaching the top positions on many Croatian musical top-lists. In June 2009. the single and the video spot 'Volim te' was released reaching the top position on the 'Pure MTV Adria Chart list'. The English version of the spot 'Volim te' was promoted on MTV Adria in November 2009. In 2010. Lollobrigida released the single and videospot 'Biv\u0161a djevojka' ('Ex-girlfriend') and in 2011. the singles and videospots 'Kompjuter' and 'Sex on TV, sex on the radio'. In numerous interviews in Croatian media Ida Prester announced in 2011 work on the third band's album. Immediately before its promotion the single 'Malo vremena' was released. The third album by Lollobrigida, 'Pilula', was premi\u00e8red on 21. January 2012 at the concert held in the club Tvornica, Zagreb. On 18.6.2012. single and the video 'Ja se resetiram' ('I'm resetting') was released, immediately attracting some international attention.\n\nMusical style and performances\n\nLyrics, music and stage performance appear to be equally important elements of the way that Lollobrigida band communicates with its audience. By insisting on honesty, simplicity and originality Lollobrigida keeps distance from standard musical and textual stereotypes, choosing instead a sort of genre indeterminacy. At variance with the latter elements, the perfection of their musical and vocal interpretations is not particularly cultivated. Ida Prester authors the lyrics of all the songs being simultaneously, taking into account the whole opus up to now, a leading author of all music as well. Critics have expressed variety of opinions about Lollobrigida; some are denying any value and/or musical importance while there are also those remarking '...Lollobrigida is the biggest thing that Croatia gave to the international music scene in the past years...'. Time Out (magazine), in its edition focusing life in Croatia, inserted band Lollobrigida on the list of 115 most prominent acts/individuals/places of contemporary Croatian culture.\n\nSince their start-up Lollobrigida was performing at numerous concerts in Croatia, Serbia, Slovenia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Hungary and Macedonia. On 1 September 2009 MTV Adria nominated Lollobrigida for the Best Regional Act Award, together with four bands from Slovenia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia. On basis of Internet voting Lollobrigida won the award, as announced on 12 October 2009. The award was handed over to the band in the course of MTV Europe Music Awards 2009 show, which took place on 5 November 2009 in Berlin, Germany in O2 World hall. Among their live performances one can especially single out a sequence of six well-accepted performances, from 2005 on, at EXIT (festival), Novi Sad, Serbia. There, Lollobrigida became a sort of a trademark of the festival's 'Elektrana' Stage. In 2009. Lollobrigida performed for the first time at the 'Fusion' Stage of EXIT (festival) and in 2010., on 10 July, at the festival's 'Main Stage'. In 2012. and 2013.,Lollobrigida kept with their shows at EXIT (festival), performing again on the Fusion Stage (2012.) and on a new  EXIT (festival)' s  stage,'Riffs&Beats' (2013.).",
  "Atherosclerosis\n\nAtherosclerosis is a pattern of the disease arteriosclerosis in which the wall of the artery develops abnormalities, called lesions. These lesions may lead to narrowing due to the buildup of atheromatous plaque. At onset there are usually no symptoms, but if they develop, symptoms generally begin around middle age. When severe, it can result in coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease, or kidney problems, depending on which arteries are affected.\n\nThe exact cause is not known and is proposed to be multifactorial. Risk factors include abnormal cholesterol levels, elevated levels of inflammatory markers, high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, obesity, family history, genetic, and an unhealthy diet. Plaque is made up of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances found in the blood. The narrowing of arteries limits the flow of oxygen-rich blood to parts of the body. Diagnosis is based upon a physical exam, electrocardiogram, and exercise stress test, among others.\n\nPrevention is generally by eating a healthy diet, exercising, not smoking, and maintaining a normal weight. Treatment of established disease may include medications to lower cholesterol such as statins, blood pressure medication, or medications that decrease clotting, such as aspirin. A number of procedures may also be carried out such as percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass graft, or carotid endarterectomy.\n\nAtherosclerosis generally starts when a person is young and worsens with age. Almost all people are affected to some degree by the age of 65. It is the number one cause of death and disability in the developed world. Though it was first described in 1575, there is evidence that the condition occurred in people more than 5,000 years ago.\n\nSigns and symptoms\n\nAtherosclerosis is asymptomatic for decades because the arteries enlarge at all plaque locations, thus there is no effect on blood flow. Even most plaque ruptures do not produce symptoms until enough narrowing or closure of an artery, due to clots, occurs. Signs and symptoms only occur after severe narrowing or closure impedes blood flow to different organs enough to induce symptoms. Most of the time, patients realize that they have the disease only when they experience other cardiovascular disorders such as stroke or heart attack. These symptoms, however, still vary depending on which artery or organ is affected.\n\nAbnormalities associated with atherosclerosis begin in childhood. Fibrous and gelatinous lesions have been observed in the coronary arteries of children aged 6\u201310. Fatty streaks have been observed in the coronary arteries of juveniles aged 11\u201315, though they appear at a much younger age within the aorta.\n\nClinically, given enlargement of the arteries for decades, symptomatic atherosclerosis is typically associated with men in their 40s and women in their 50s to 60s. Sub-clinically, the disease begins to appear in childhood and rarely is already present at birth. Noticeable signs can begin developing at puberty. Though symptoms are rarely exhibited in children, early screening of children for cardiovascular diseases could be beneficial to both the child and his/her relatives. While coronary artery disease is more prevalent in men than women, atherosclerosis of the cerebral arteries and strokes equally affect both sexes.\n\nMarked narrowing in the coronary arteries, which are responsible for bringing oxygenated blood to the heart, can produce symptoms such as chest pain of angina and shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, dizziness or light-headedness, breathlessness or palpitations. Abnormal heart rhythms called arrhythmias\u2014the heart beating either too slowly or too quickly\u2014are another consequence of ischemia.\n\nCarotid arteries supply blood to the brain and neck. Marked narrowing of the carotid arteries can present with symptoms such as: a feeling of weakness; being unable to think straight; difficulty speaking; dizziness; difficulty in walking or standing up straight; blurred vision; numbness of the face, arms and legs; severe headache; and loss of consciousness. These symptoms are also related to stroke (death of brain cells). Stroke is caused by marked narrowing or closure of arteries going to the brain; lack of adequate blood supply leads to the death of the cells of the affected tissue.\n\nPeripheral arteries, which supply blood to the legs, arms and pelvis, also experience marked narrowing due to plaque rupture and clots. Symptoms of the narrowing are numbness within the arms or legs, as well as pain. Another significant location for plaque formation is the renal arteries, which supply blood to the kidneys. Plaque occurrence and accumulation lead to decreased kidney blood flow and chronic kidney disease, which, like in all other areas, is typically asymptomatic until late stages.\n\nAccording to United States data for 2004, in about 66% of men and 47% of women, the first symptom of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is a heart attack or sudden cardiac death (death within one hour of onset of the symptom). Cardiac stress testing, traditionally the most commonly performed non-invasive testing method for blood flow limitations, in general, detects only lumen narrowing of \u224875% or greater, although some physicians claim that nuclear stress methods can detect as little as 50%.\n\nCase studies have included autopsies of U.S. soldiers killed in World War II and the Korean War. A much-cited report involved the autopsies of 300 U.S. soldiers killed in Korea. Although the average age of the men was 22.1 years, 77.3 percent had \"gross evidence of coronary arteriosclerosis\". Other studies done of soldiers in the Vietnam War showed similar results, although often worse than the ones from the earlier wars. Theories include high rates of tobacco use and (in the case of the Vietnam soldiers) the advent of processed foods after World War II.\n\nRisk factors\n\nThe atherosclerotic process is not well understood. Atherosclerosis is associated with inflammatory processes in the endothelial cells of the vessel wall associated with retained low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles. This retention may be a cause, an effect, or both, of the underlying inflammatory process.\n\nThe presence of the plaque induces the muscle cells of the blood vessel to stretch, compensating for the additional bulk. The endothelial lining then thickens, increasing the separation between the plaque and lumen. The thickening somewhat offsets the narrowing caused by the growth of the plaque, but moreover, it causes the wall to stiffen and become less compliant to stretching with each heartbeat.\n\nDietary\n\nThe relation between dietary fat and atherosclerosis is controversial. The USDA, in its food pyramid, promotes a diet of about 64% carbohydrates from total calories. The American Heart Association, the American Diabetes Association and the National Cholesterol Education Program make similar recommendations. In contrast, Prof Walter Willett (Harvard School of Public Health, PI of the second Nurses' Health Study) recommends much higher levels of fat, especially of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat. These dietary recommendations reach a consensus, though, against consumption of trans fats.\n\nThe role of eating oxidized fats (rancid fats) in humans is not clear. Rabbits fed rancid fats develop atherosclerosis faster. Rats fed DHA-containing oils experienced marked disruptions to their antioxidant systems, and accumulated significant amounts of phospholipid hydroperoxide in their blood, livers and kidneys.\n\nRabbits fed atherogenic diets containing various oils were found to undergo the most oxidative susceptibility of LDL via polyunsaturated oils. In another study, rabbits fed heated soybean oil \"grossly induced atherosclerosis and marked liver damage were histologically and clinically demonstrated.\" However, Fred Kummerow claims that it is not dietary cholesterol, but oxysterols, or oxidized cholesterols, from fried foods and smoking, that are the culprit.\n\nRancid fats and oils taste very unpleasant in even small amounts, so people avoid eating them. It is very difficult to measure or estimate the actual human consumption of these substances. Highly unsaturated omega-3 rich oils such as fish oil, when being sold in pill form, can hide the taste of oxidized or rancid fat that might be present. In the US, the health food industry's dietary supplements are self-regulated and outside of FDA regulations. To properly protect unsaturated fats from oxidation, it is best to keep them cool and in oxygen-free environments.\n\nPathophysiology\n\nAtherogenesis is the developmental process of atheromatous plaques. It is characterized by a remodeling of arteries leading to subendothelial accumulation of fatty substances called plaques. The buildup of an atheromatous plaque is a slow process, developed over a period of several years through a complex series of cellular events occurring within the arterial wall and in response to a variety of local vascular circulating factors. One recent hypothesis suggests that, for unknown reasons, leukocytes, such as monocytes or basophils, begin to attack the endothelium of the artery lumen in cardiac muscle. The ensuing inflammation leads to the formation of atheromatous plaques in the arterial tunica intima, a region of the vessel wall located between the endothelium and the tunica media. The bulk of these lesions is made of excess fat, collagen, and elastin. At first, as the plaques grow, only wall thickening occurs without any narrowing. Stenosis is a late event, which may never occur and is often the result of repeated plaque rupture and healing responses, not just the atherosclerotic process by itself.\n\nCellular\n\nEarly atherogenesis is characterized by the adherence of blood circulating monocytes (a type of white blood cell) to the vascular bed lining, the endothelium, then by their migration to the sub-endothelial space, and further activation into monocyte-derived macrophages. The primary documented driver of this process is oxidized lipoprotein particles within the wall, beneath the endothelial cells, though upper normal or elevated concentrations of blood glucose also plays a major role and not all factors are fully understood. Fatty streaks may appear and disappear.\n\nLow-density lipoprotein",

  "Linda (Sesame Street)\n\nLinda, portrayed by Linda Bove, was a character on the children's program Sesame Street. Bove, who is deaf, appeared on Sesame Street with the National Theater of the Deaf and made her debut on the show in Episode 0243, which aired in April 1971. Initially appearing on a sporadic basis, she became a regular member of the cast in 1975, and continued to appear until 2002. In 2019, Linda returned to the franchise in the television special Sesame Street's 50th Anniversary Celebration, 17 years after her last appearance.\n\nThis deaf character communicated only in sign language but interacted positively with other members of the Sesame Street community as a normal citizen and resident of Sesame Street. The person who most often acted as her interpreter was Bob; eventually, he and Linda were portrayed as being in a romantic relationship. Linda made her living as a librarian, and as such she also had an assistant, Micki (Micki Barnett). Micki would read the stories to the children, while Linda communicated them in sign language.\n\nThe staff writers at Sesame Street were initially unsure of how to write for her. Linda Bove explained, \"When I joined the cast I found the writers would write about 'How would a deaf person do this?' 'How does a deaf person do that?' And it was just related to my deafness and it didn't feel like they were treating me as a person. I found my character one-dimensional and kind of boring. It showed how brave a deaf person was to do this and that in everyday life. I said it was no big deal. I have a sense of humor; why don't you show that? I can be angry over something. Show that I can have a relationship with another person. Maybe a love relationship with Bob. It's not perfect, but... We do have misunderstandings over sign language, make fun of it, and show the funny side of it. It's OK.\"\n\nLinda also appeared in numerous inserts and sketches, notably the famous silent sketches where Maria (Sonia Manzano) would play Charlie Chaplin and Linda would often play a supporting role, either as a pretty woman or as a second Chaplin if two were required for a particular sketch.",
  "Kamini Kaushal\n\nKamini Kaushal (born Uma Kashyap, 24 February 1927) is an Indian actress who worked in Hindi films and television. She is noted for her roles in films such as Neecha Nagar (1946), which won the 1946 Palme d'Or (Golden Palm) at Cannes Film Festival and Biraj Bahu (1955), which won her the Filmfare Award for Best Actress in 1955.\n\nShe played lead heroine in films from 1946 to 1963, wherein her roles in Do Bhai (1947), Shaheed (1948), Nadiya Ke Paar (1948), Ziddi (1948), Shabnam (1949), Paras (1949), Namoona (1949), Arzoo (1950), Jhanjar (1953), Aabroo (1956), Bade Sarkar (1957), Jailor (1958), Night Club (1958) and Godaan (1963) are considered her career's best performances. She played character roles since 1963, and was critically acclaimed for her performance in Shaheed (1965). She appeared in three films of Rajesh Khanna, namely Do Raaste (1969), Prem Nagar (1974), Maha Chor (1976), in Anhonee (1973) with Sanjeev Kumar and in eight films with Manoj Kumar namely Shaheed, Upkar (1967), Purab Aur Paschim (1970), Shor (1972), Roti Kapda Aur Makaan (1974), Sanyasi (1975), Dus Numbri (1976) and Santosh (1989). In the 2010s decade, she took brief but praised supporting roles in the action comedy Chennai Express (2013) and the romantic drama Kabir Singh (2019), both of which rank among the highest grossing Indian films.\n\nEarly life\n\nKamini Kaushal was born in Lahore. She is the youngest of two brothers and three sisters. She is the daughter of Prof. Shiv Ram Kashyap, Professor of Botany, University of Punjab at Lahore, British India (present-day Pakistan). Prof. Kashyap is widely regarded as the father of Indian Botany. Her father was a distinguished botanist who discovered six species of plants. She was only seven when her father died on 26 November 1934. She did her B.A. (honors) in English literature from Government College in Lahore. She got an offer to act in films through Chetan Anand in 1946 with Neecha Nagar.\n\nTalking about her teenage years, she said in an interview, \"I had no time to fool. I didn't have any crush. I was busy swimming, riding, skating and doing radio plays on Akashwani, for which I was paid Rs 10.\" When her elder sister died in a car accident, leaving behind two daughters, Kaushal had to marry her brother-in-law, B.S. Sood in 1948. She set up home in Bombay where her husband was a chief engineer in Bombay Port Trust. Her elder sister's daughters are Kumkum Somani and Kavita Sahni. Kumkum Somani has written a book for children on Gandhi's philosophy and Kavita Sahni is an artist. Kamini had three sons after 1955, Rahul, Vidur and Shravan.\n\nIn the 1950s, the couple lived in a spacious manor-type house \"Gateside\" in Mazagaon, which was allotted to her husband by BPT.\n\nCareer\n\nKamini had been a stage actress in Delhi during her college days from 1942 to 1945. She worked as a radio child artist with the name \"Uma\" in Lahore before the Partition, from 1937 to 1940. She said in an interview about whether she wanted to be an actress in her childhood: \"I come from a very intellectual family. My dad, S. R. Kashyap, was a professor at Government College, Lahore and the President of the Science Congress. He'd written about 50 books on botany. Growing up, our family concentrated more on knowledge, but he never deterred us from doing anything we wanted as long as it was positive.\" Though she had no dreams of joining the film industry while being in college, she was a fan of actor Ashok Kumar. Once she said in an interview: \"We were to perform for the war relief fund in college. Ashok Kumar and Leela Chitins were the chief guests. After the show we went to meet him. I thought of having some fun. As he stood talking to the students, I pulled his hair from behind.\" Chetan Anand gave her the role of the leading heroine in his film Neecha Nagar. This movie was done by her before marriage and released in 1946. She quoted in an interview, when asked about why her name was changed from Uma to Kamini: \"Chetan's wife Uma Anand was also part of the film. My name also being Uma, he wanted a different name for me. I asked him to give me a name beginning with 'K' to match with the names of my daughters Kumkum and Kavita.\" She won an award at the Montreal Film Festival for her performance in her debut film. She quoted in an interview about how she got her debut film: \"Ravi Shankar was new, he had not done music for anybody. It was Zohra Segal's debut. Uma Anand (Chetan's wife) was with us in college \u2014 we were together. Chetan had been teaching at The Doon School and got to me through my brother.\".\n\nAfter Neecha Nagar, she returned to Lahore, but offers started coming in, hence she used to come for shooting from Lahore. After her sudden marriage in 1947, she settled in Bombay with her husband. She became the first leading heroine to continue working as lead film heroine after her marriage as well. Kamini was one of the first well educated heroines (BA in English) in Hindi cinema. She learnt Bharatnatyam at Mumbai's Sri Rajarajeswari Bharata Natya Kala Mandir, where Guru T. K. Mahalingam Pillai, doyen among nattuvanars taught. Since 1948, Kamini Kaushal worked with all the top leading men of her time, such as Ashok Kumar, Raj Kapoor, Dev Anand, Raaj Kumar and Dilip Kumar.\n\nIn every film starring her as lead heroine, except when opposite Ashok Kumar, in the period 1947 to 1955, her name used to appear first in the credits before the leading hero's name appeared. Her pairing opposite Dilip Kumar was popular with audiences with box office hits such as Shaheed (1948), Pugree, Nadiya Ke Paar (1949), Shabnam (1949) and Arzoo (1950)). The popularity as an actress increased with Filmistan's Do Bhai (1947), aided by Geeta Roy's impassioned singing of songs such as \"Mera sundar sapna\", which, incidentally, was shot in a single take. Kamini was paired opposite Dev Anand in his very first success, Bombay Talkies' production Ziddi (1948), a light romance. The pair followed this up with Namoona. Kamini played the third angle to the Dev-Suraiya pair in Shayar. In Raj Kapoor's directorial debut Aag (1948), she did a cameo as one of his three heroines (Nargis and Nigar were the other two), whose relationship with the hero doesn't fructify. She also starred with Raj Kapoor in Jail Yatra.\n\nKamini Kaushal was the first lead heroine for whom Lata Mangeshkar ever sang for and it was for the film Ziddi in 1948. Kamini quoted in an interview: \"Lata sang for me in Ziddi for the first time. That was the first time she sang for the leading lady in a film. Before that, she sang for actresses in supporting roles. Shamshad Begum and Surinder Kaur \u2014 whose voices had more bass \u2014 used to sing my songs. On the music credits on the record, Lata's name was not mentioned. Instead, it was mentioned that Asha sang the songs \u2014 Asha was my screen name (in the film Ziddi). That's why people thought I had sung it. The playback singers - Kishore Kumar and Lata Mangeshkar recorded their first duet - \"Ye Kaun Aya Re\" together in the 1948 film Ziddi.\n\nHer other successful films as lead heroine in films from 1946 to 1963 include Paras (1949), Namoona, Jhanjar, Aabru, Night Club, Jailor, Bade Sarkar, Bada Bhai, Poonam and Godaan. Kamini became a producer and signed on then-matinee idol Ashok Kumar in Poonam and Night Club. She did lighthearted roles in Chalis Baba Ek Chor (1954) and also did serious tragedy genre roles in Aas, Ansoo and Jailor. In the Sohrab Modi-directed Jailor (1958), Kamini gave a goosebump-raising performance as Modi's wife, who is pushed towards adultery by his ruthless tyranny. Trilok Jetley, who adopted Premchand's famous story Godaan on screen, put his film on hold, while Kamini was pregnant with her second child, because he wanted to capitalise on the softness in her voice",
  "Carbonic anhydrase III, muscle specific\n\nCarbonic anhydrase 3 is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the CA3 gene.\n\nCarbonic anhydrase III (CAIII) is a member of a multigene family (at least six separate genes are known) that encode carbonic anhydrase isozymes. These carbonic anhydrases are a class of metalloenzymes that catalyze the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide and are differentially expressed in a number of cell types. The expression of the CA3 gene is strictly tissue-specific and present at high levels in skeletal muscle and much lower levels in cardiac and smooth muscle. CA3 is insufficient in muscles of Myasthenia Gravis patients. A proportion of carriers of Duchenne muscle dystrophy have a higher CA3 level than normal. Autoantibodies to CA3 have been found to be significantly higher in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and type 1 diabetes. The gene spans 10.3 kb and contains seven exons and six introns.",
  "Southside Christian School\n\nSouthside Christian School is a private K-12 Christian school in Simpsonville, South Carolina. SCS was established in 1967 and is accredited by the Association of Christian Schools International. SCS serves approximately 1100 students beginning at 18 months of age and continuing through 12th grade on one campus. Students are divided into Early Education (EE2\u2013EE5), Lower School (1st\u20135th), and Upper School (6th\u201312th).\n\nHistory\n\nSouthside Christian School was one of five all-white private schools that were established in Greenville County between 1966 and 1970 when Greenville public schools were being desegregated. Southside Christian School officials, however, have denied that school was established to facilitate racially segregated education.\n\nIn 1978, Southside Christian School administrator Ron Brooks spoke at a conference organized by opponents of an IRS regulation that would revoke the tax exemptions of private schools that had significantly different racial composition than the surrounding community. Brooks said that it was \"wrong for the government to get involved in our church\" and claimed that the school did not \"keep track of students by race\". Brooks argued that since Southside Christian School was formed before the final court order desegregating Greenville schools, the school was not a discriminatory institution.\n\nIn 2002, Southside Christian School received inquiries from parents seeking to withdraw their children from public schools after a racially charged debate on school assignment zone changes.\n\nThe school's gymnasium was destroyed in a fire on November 20, 2002.\n\nSports\n\nSCS is a 1A member of the South Carolina High School League, with boys and girls teams competing in 19 sports.\n\nBoys\n\n\u2022 Baseball\n\n\u2022 Basketball\n\n\u2022 Cross Country\n\n\u2022 Football\n\n\u2022 Golf\n\n\u2022 Soccer\n\n\u2022 Swimming\n\n\u2022 Tennis\n\n\u2022 Track and Field\n\nGirls\n\n\u2022 Basketball\n\n\u2022 Cheerleading\n\n\u2022 Cross Country\n\n\u2022 Fastpitch Softball\n\n\u2022 Golf\n\n\u2022 Soccer\n\n\u2022 Swimming\n\n\u2022 Tennis\n\n\u2022 Track and Field\n\n\u2022 Volleyball",
  "2004 United States presidential election in New Hampshire\n\nThe 2004 United States presidential election in New Hampshire took place on November 2, 2004, and was part of the 2004 United States presidential election. Voters chose four representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\n\nNew Hampshire was won by Democratic nominee John Kerry by a 1.4% margin of victory. Prior to the election, most news organizations considered it as a swing state. Traditionally a more Republican leaning state of the heavily Democratic New England region, it was the only state in all of the Northeast to vote Republican in 2000. The state is considered to be more fiscally conservative than its neighbors in New England. However, like the rest of New England, it is considerably more liberal on social issues, which benefits Democratic candidates. New Hampshire was the only state that Bush won in the 2000 presidential election but lost in the 2004 presidential election. Bush became the first Republican to ever win a presidential election without carrying New Hampshire, as well as the only incumbent Republican president as of 2020 to win another term in office without carrying the state. He was also the second consecutive Republican president (after his father) to lose New Hampshire in his second election after winning it in his first. This was also the first time since 1848 that a losing Democrat would carry New Hampshire, and the first time since 1976 (as well as the last time until 2016) that the state would back the losing candidate in a presidential election. Kerry's victory in the state, off the heels of Bush's statewide victory in the 2000 presidential election, makes New Hampshire the only state in the union to vote for the loser of the national popular vote in both 2000 and 2004.\n\nDemocratic primary\n\nThe 2004 New Hampshire Democratic Primary was held on January 27, 2004. Taking place 8 days after the Iowa caucuses, it marked the second contest to take place during the Democratic party's 2004 primary season, as well as the first actual primary to take place.\n\nPolling\n\nPrimary polling taken by American Research Group during the last few days of campaigning (January 23 to January 27, 2004) showed that former New Hampshire poll leader as well as national leader Howard Dean was steadily gaining ground to catch up to now front-runner John Kerry.\n\nGathered from ARG's 2004 NH Democratic Tracking Poll\n\nMargin of Error +/- 4\n\nTracking polling showed that Dean had been catching up to Kerry in the days before the primary, cutting Kerry's 18 point lead to 10 points in a matter of days. With Dean dropping and Kerry rising, it became apparent that the battle for 1st place in New Hampshire would be close. Also, for third place, Wesley Clark, John Edwards and Joe Lieberman were the only ones fighting for third. With Clark and Edwards both taking hits going into the primary, a Lieberman on the rise, the fight for 1st place and third place, according to polls would be intense.\n\nResults\n\nAs results began to come in during Primary night, it became apparent Kerry had won the primary and was promptly projected the winner by several media outlets. Dean finished in second place. Clark and Edwards were in a dead-lock for third place, with both candidates at 12% during the night. Earlier returns showed Lieberman in a stronger position to tie with Clark and Edwards, allowing him to declare to his supporters that it was \"a three-way split decision for third place.\"\n\nAs final results were being tallied, Kerry won the primary with 84,277 votes and 38%, Dean finished second, with 57,761 and 26%, and Clark narrowly defeated Edwards for third place, with 27,314 votes and 12%. Lieberman had fallen back in the count and didn't even reach 10%.\n\nExit Polling\n\nSource: CNN.com 2004 Primaries\n\nKerry won huge margins of support amongst almost all constituencies, with his only weak point amongst Republicans, who made up 4% of the voting block and was Lieberman's strongest point. Dean repeatedly came distant second or third for almost all categories of voters. Edwards defeated Clark amongst male voters as well as voters under 65, but only by a very tiny margin. Lieberman finished in a distant third in almost all categories except for Republicans, in which he nearly defeated John Kerry.\n\nPredictions\n\nThere were 12 news organizations who made state-by-state predictions of the election. Here are their last predictions before election day.\n\nPolling\n\nPre-election polling was back and forth, with no clear indication who would end up winning the state. The final 3 polls averaged Kerry leading 48% to 47%, with the undecided voters, making up just 3%, deciding the election.\n\nFundraising\n\nBush raised $598,474. Kerry raised $766,720.\n\nAdvertising and visits\n\nBush visited the state 6 times, while Kerry visited the state 4 times. Each campaign spent between $100,000 to $300,000 each week.\n\nAnalysis\n\nNew Hampshire, historically considered to be a more conservative state compared to the rest of New England, had by the early 2000s become a swing state in presidential elections, having voted for Democrat Bill Clinton twice in the 1990s but narrowly choosing Republican George W. Bush in 2000. However the state began heavily trending Democratic after 2000. Bush's approval ratings were consistently below 50% in 2004. Also, polling in the state consistently showed Kerry leading, and with between 47% to 50% of the vote.\n\nOn election day, Kerry won with just over 50% of the vote, with a small margin of victory, as expected from the polls. Major factors include Bush's lower approval ratings and just 1% who voted for third-party candidates, unlike 2000 when over 4% of the people voted for an independent. Kerry won 6 of the 10 counties. Most of the counties were won and lost by small margins. Kerry's key to victory was winning Cheshire County with over 59%. Bush's best performance was in Belknap County, which he won with over 55% and carrying every single town. Bush won New Hampshire's 1st congressional district, and Kerry won New Hampshire's 2nd congressional district. This was also the first presidential election since 1968 when Coos County would back the losing candidate (thus making Bush the first Republican since 1968 to win the White House without carrying this county), and only the second time since 1892 when that would occur overall. This would later be repeated when Donald Trump won the county over Joe Biden in 2020 despite losing the presidential election that year. Bush became the first ever Republican to win the White House without carrying Sullivan County.\n\nBy congressional district\n\nBush and Kerry each won a congressional district. Kerry won a district held by a Republican.\n\nElectors\n\nTechnically the voters of NH cast their ballots for electors: representatives to the Electoral College. NH is allocated 4 electors because it has 2 congressional districts and 2 senators. All candidates who appear on the ballot or qualify to receive write-in votes must submit a list of 4 electors, who pledge to vote for their candidate and his or her running mate. Whoever wins the majority of votes in the state is awarded all 4 electoral votes. Their chosen electors then vote for president and vice president. Although electors are pledged to their candidate and running mate, they are not obligated to vote for them. An elector who votes for someone other than his or her candidate is known as a faithless elector.\n\nThe electors of each state and the District of Columbia met on December 13, 2004, to cast their votes for president and vice president. The Electoral College itself never meets as one body. Instead the electors from each state and the District of Columbia met in their respective capitols.\n\nThe following were the members of the Electoral College from the state. All 4 were pledged for Kerry/Edwards:",

  "Sedicicorto International Film Festival\n\nThe Sedicicorto International Film Festival (sometimes stylised as 16corto) is a competitive short film festival held each October in the Italian city of Forl\u00ec since 2004.\n\nHistory\n\nIn March 2004, the Sedicicorto Association was founded in Forl\u00ec by Gianluca Castellini with the aim to launch the first short film festival of the Romagna subregion. The project was born during a directing course held by an Argentinian photographer in Forl\u00ec, with Castellini as a participant.\n\nThe first edition of the festival was established in October 2004. The event lasted four days and was of national character. Starting from 2005, more sections were added in order to award all categories of short films. In 2020, the nine-day festival presented awards for five sections: foreign films, Italian films, experimental animated films, children's films and films under two minutes. Alongside the official selection of about 200 titles out from 5'000 submissions, the festival screens films out of competition. Since 2018, an Iran short film festival is organised annually along with the Sedicicorto. All screenings are held in the theatres of the old town of Forl\u00ec.\n\nThe name Sedicicorto is a pun on the Italian expression \"se dici corto\" (if you say short). When artistic director Gianluca Castellini was taking suggestions for the title, he asked his friends: \"If you say short (film), what makes you think?\". The title is often stylised as 16corto because sedici in Italian means \"sixteen\".",

  "John Brent (antiquary)\n\nJohn Brent (1808\u20131882) was an English antiquary and novelist.\n\nBiography\n\nBrent was born in Rotherhithe, London on 21 August 1808, and was the eldest son of a father of the same name, a shipbuilder there, who about the year 1821 removed to Canterbury, and became thrice mayor of the city and deputy-lieutenant of the county. His mother was Susannah, third daughter of the Rev. Sampson Kingsford of Sturry, near Canterbury.\n\nIn his early days Brent carried on the business of a miller, occupied for many years a seat on the council of the Canterbury corporation, and was elected an alderman, but resigned that position on being appointed city treasurer.\n\nDuring the course of a long life, Brent was indefatigable in his attempts to throw light on the history of the city and county in which he dwelt. He became a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in April 1853, and was also a member of the British Archaeological Association and of the Kent Archaeological Society.\n\nAfter the failure of the November Uprising (Polish\u2013Russian War 1830\u201331), Brent became the local secretary of the Polish Association. He died at his house on the Dane John, Canterbury, 23 April 1882.\n\nHistorical works\n\nBrent's contributions to antiquarian literature are mostly to be found in the various publications of the societies to which he belonged. To the forty-first volume of the Arch\u00e6ologia (pp. 409\u201320) he communicated a paper of value to ethnological science, being an account of his \"Researches in an Anglo-Saxon Cemetery at Stowting, in Kent, during the autumn of 1866\".\n\nIn 1855 Brent had published a revised edition of Felix Summerly's Handbook for Canterbury, and in 1875 there appeared his Catalogue of the Antiquities in the Canterbury Museum, of which he was honorary curator. His work Canterbury in the Olden Time, 8vo, (enlarged edition in 1879), from its research and originality, bears testimony to his unwearied industry and his ability as an antiquarian topographer.\n\nPoetry and novels\n\nBrent also claims notice as a poet and novelist, having published: Numerous tales, poems, and miscellaneous articles from his pen are also to be found in the various magazines devoted to light literature.",

  "Fleck/Paterson House\n\nFleck/Paterson House is a historic building in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Built in 1903 as a private residence, it has since served a number of functions, and currently serves as the Algerian Embassy to Canada.\n\nHistory\n\nThe house was built between 1901 and 1903 by Ottawa lumber baron J.R. Booth who built it for his daughter Gertrude and her husband Andrew Fleck. It was designed by John W.H. Watts, who also designed Booth House. Gertrude Fleck lived there until her death in 1940 when it was purchased by Senator Norman Paterson who lived in it until his death in 1983.\n\nAfter Paterson's death, the house was bought by developers who hoped to turn it into a retirement home. These efforts fell through, however, and the house was left abandoned for a number of years. It fell victim to vandalism and water damage before being bought by local developer Robert Van Eyk in 1989 for some $1.3 million with the plan to turn it into a bed and breakfast. However, since the building was zoned only for residential purposes, the city blocked this plan. In 1992, the building was sold to Maharishi Heaven on Earth Development Corp. for just over a million dollars. They hoped to turn the structure into a meditation centre and headquarters of the Natural Law Party of Canada. Extensive renovations, reportedly costing almost two million dollars, were undertaken and the building was fully restored.\n\nAlgerian embassy\n\nIn 2002, the Maharishi Corp. sold the building for $2.95 million to Algeria.

  "William fitzBaderon\n\nWilliam fitzBaderon (c. 1060/65? &ndash; before 1138) was an Anglo-Norman nobleman of Breton descent, who was lord of Monmouth between about 1082 and 1125. He was mentioned in the Domesday Book as being responsible for Monmouth Castle and ten other manors in the surrounding region, and was responsible in 1101 for the consecration of the town's Priory which had been established in 1075 by his uncle Withenoc.\n\nLife\n\nHe was the son of Baderon, a nobleman of La Boussac, near Dol in Brittany. Baderon was the son of Caradoc de La Boussac, a nobleman with estates near Dol in Brittany. Baderon's brother Withenoc (or Gwithenoc) was appointed lord of Monmouth by King William after the disgrace of Roger de Breteuil in 1075, and founded the Priory at Monmouth. The pious Withenoc then gave up his secular responsibilities in about 1082 to become a monk at Saumur, and, because his own son Raterius and his brother Baderon were also monks, the responsibilities fell on Baderon's son, William. Withenoc's responsibilities initially passed for a short time to Ranulf de Colville, perhaps because William had not yet reached adulthood.\n\nIn any event, by the time of the Domesday Book in 1086, William had become a major landowner. Besides his castle at Monmouth, he was also lord of Huntley, Longhope, Ruardean, and Siddington, in Gloucestershire; and of Ashperton, Hope Mansell, Munsley, Stretton Grandison, Walsopthorne and Whitwick, in Herefordshire. At Monmouth, he may have been responsible for completing the rebuilding of the original wooden motte and bailey castle in stone.\n\nHe and his family, together with his vassals, their wives, and Wihenoc, were present when Monmouth Priory was consecrated in 1101. William was of sufficient eminence to attract to the ceremony such notables as King Henry's chaplain, Bernard. William granted, to the abbey of Saint Florent at Saumur, the Priory Church of St Mary at Monmouth, \"and all their churches, and the tithes of all their lands and of all their tenants, namely, of grain, of stock, of honey, of iron, of mills, of cheeses, and of whatever is tithed. They also gave, near the castle of Monemuda (Monmouth) the land of three ploughs and the mill of Milebroc (?), and a meadow at Blakenalre (?), and land at St. Cadoc (Llangattock-Vibon-Avel), and a meadow beneath their castle, and a virgate of land, namely, Godric's, and at Siddington a hide of land, and in all their woods pannage for swine of the monks' demesne.

  "The Glass Shield\n\nThe Glass Shield is a 1994 American crime drama film co-written and directed by Charles Burnett. It stars Michael Boatman and Lori Petty as rookie police officers who uncover a conspiracy around the arrest of a suspect (Ice Cube). After a festival run, it was released in the United States on June 2, 1995, and grossed $3.3 million.\n\nPlot\n\nJohn \"J. J.\" Johnson is a rookie deputy sheriff in the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department. Because of his inexperience and race, he experiences tension with his white colleagues as their first black deputy. Although he initially clashes with Deputy Deborah Fields, the department's first female deputy, they strike up a friendship. While on patrol, Johnson backs up Deputy Bono when he stops a black man, Teddy Woods, at a gas station. When Bono runs Woods' drivers license, he finds a warrant for his arrest. Woods reveals he has a stolen pistol in his car, and the police officers arrest him.\n\nDeputy Fields is the second deputy to the scene of a murder, but Detectives Baker and Hall dismiss her observations. Mr. Greenspan says a black man murdered his wife in a botched robbery, and the detectives pressure Woods to confess after they trace his stolen pistol to the murder. Woods defiantly proclaims his innocence, frustrating his lawyer, James Locket, who advises him to show less attitude in court. At the same time, community activist Reverend Banks raises awareness of the death of a black prisoner whom he believes to have been murdered by the police while in custody. Johnson dismisses the concerns of his family and girlfriend, saying there is no evidence of this.\n\nWhile coaching Bono on what to say at the trial, Johnson's commander, Clarence Massey, learns that Bono stopped Woods because of his race. Frustrated, Massey instructs him to come up with a better excuse. Bono suggests a traffic violation and later requests that Johnson back him up. Johnson agrees, and Massey praises him for his loyalty and dependability while chastising Fields for her refusal to fit in better. At the trial, Locket points out holes in the police testimony, making Johnson wonder if he made the right decision. Fields joins Johnson in investigating what really happened. With help from a whistleblower, they discover numerous cover-ups that involve Baker, Hall, and Massey.\n\nAs the trial progresses and Greenspan's testimony proves problematic, Massey has Baker murder Greenspan to prevent him from becoming a liability. Hall, sick from cancer, dies at the station. Tensions rise as Johnson and Fields continue pursuing their own investigation, and they become further paranoid when Johnson insists they were intentionally given faulty intelligence during a drug raid. After Fields is hospitalized following an assault, Johnson and Baker come to blows. Massey breaks them up and temporarily places Johnson in a jail cell. When released, he delivers incriminating evidence to Locket that implicates Baker in various crimes, including the murder of the black prisoner and framing Woods.\n\nThe jury can not reach a verdict. Facing a widespread investigation of police corruption that goes to the city council and mayor's office, the district attorney offers to drop the charges against Woods. Locket, with the reluctant backing of a city councilman, instead pushes for a new trial, which the judge accepts. Bono turns state's evidence and testifies against Johnson, admitting that the two committed perjury. Caught up in the probe, Johnson pleads guilty and receives a suspended sentence. After the sheriff's department is disbanded, Massey retires, Baker is sentenced to four years and is in an honor prison while appealing. The unit is disbanded and the other officers including Bono are reassigned.\n\nProduction\n\nThe budget was under $5 million.\n\nReception\n\nRotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 68% of 25 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 5.6/10. Todd McCarthy of Variety called it a \"powerful moral drama\" that addresses too many issues for one film. While commenting on how it presaged the O. J. Simpson murder trial, Caryn James of The New York Times called it smart and compelling. Peter Ranier of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \"It's a rigorous, angry piece of work, but it misses out on the psychological depths that have made Burnett's previous films among the glories of recent American independent moviemaking.\" Hal Hinson of The Washington Post, in comparing it negatively to television cop dramas, described it as \"a topical but otherwise unremarkable police drama\". Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune rated it 3/4 stars and wrote, \"It's unusual to see a police thriller told with this kind of care, subtlety, thoughtfulness and creativity.\"\n\nAt the 1994 Locarno International Film Festival, Charles Burnett was nominated for the Golden Leopard.",

  "Otis Moss III\n\nOtis Moss III (born 16 September 1970) is the pastor of Chicago's Trinity United Church of Christ. He espouses black theology and speaks about reaching inner-city black youth.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nHis father Otis Moss Jr. was an affiliate of Martin Luther King Jr. working together in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and serving in 1971 as co-pastor with his father Martin Luther King, Sr. at Ebenezer Baptist Church.\n\nAfter growing up in the Cleveland suburb of Shaker Heights, Ohio, graduating from Shaker Heights High School, Moss attended Morehouse College in Georgia as an undergraduate, initially majoring in political science and film with the intent of becoming a filmmaker. He was a runner and named by the NCAA as an All-American Track and Field athlete. After hearing his call to the ministry during track practice, he changed majors to religion and philosophy and graduated with honors in 1992.\n\nHe then attended Yale University in Connecticut, receiving in 1995 a Master of Divinity degree with a concentration in ethics and theology. During his time at Yale he became enamored of the black theology of James Hal Cone. He was also ordained as a Baptist minister by his father in 1995.\n\nMoss moved to Denver to study for a Ph.D. in religion and social change from a joint program of the University of Denver and the Iliff School of Theology, a Methodist seminary. However, he entered ministry full-time before completing the degree. While in Denver, he became the minister of youth programs at the New Hope Baptist Church. A sermon tape from a youth rally was given to the retiring pastor of Tabernacle Baptist Church in Augusta, Georgia, leading to his call there.\n\nTabernacle Baptist years\n\nIn 1997, Moss moved to Augusta, Georgia, to take up the pastorate at Tabernacle Baptist Church, founded in 1885 as Beulah Baptist Church. During the Civil Rights Movement the church served as a local base for that movement.\n\nAt the time Moss took over the church, it had 125 members, growing to 2,100 members by the time he left it in 2006, reportedly mostly through the inclusion of formerly unchurched young people. During his tenure, the church also undertook a major renovation of their historic building.\n\nIn 2000, he published a sermon collection entitled Redemption in a Red Light District - Messages of Hope, Healing and Empowerment, consisting of sermons from his first year of ministry. He also periodically swapped pulpits with the pastor of the First Baptist Church of Augusta, where the Southern Baptist Convention was originally organized in support of slavery.\n\nIn 2002, he was the first recipient of a prize, carrying a $25,000 stipend, for exemplary community service, evangelism and preaching. He had been nominated by the historian of the Chautauqua Institution in New York who considered him one of the best to have preached there. The prize is jointly awarded by three Presbyterian organizations; the Columbia Theological Seminary, the Presbyterian College, and the Peachtree Presbyterian Church of Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nDuring this period, Moss was a member of the Progressive National Baptist Convention as well as state and local Baptist organizations. Politically, he was a member of the NAACP and the Georgia branch of the Rainbow/Push Coalition founded by Jesse Jackson. He also served on the boards of the local United Way chapter and Augusta's black history museum, which is named after Lucy Craft Laney.\n\nTrinity United Church of Christ\n\nMoss received two job offers. One was to come to the Olivet Institutional Baptist Church in Cleveland, Ohio to succeed his father as pastor, the other to move to Chicago's Trinity United Church, a United Church of Christ (UCC) church pastored by Jeremiah Wright, to become Wright's successor at the roughly 8,500-member megachurch. Moss says that after prayer and fasting, he felt God's call was for him to go to Chicago, and did so in 2006, initially as Wright's assistant. Moss assumed responsibility for regular preaching at Trinity on March 9, 2008, and was installed as the senior pastor in May 2009.\n\nEarly in 2007, Moss was one of four additional contributors to the book The Gospel Remix: Reaching the Hip Hop Generation by Professor Ralph C. Watkins of the Fuller Theological Seminary. That summer, Moss was one of several black ministers who gave eulogies at a mock funeral the NAACP put on for the word \"nigger\", where he described it as \"the greatest child that racism ever birthed\".\n\n, Moss is a board member of The Christian Century.\n\nPersonal life\n\nMoss is married and has two children.",
  "Cooperative Marketing Act\n\nThe Cooperative Marketing Act of 1926 44 Stat. 802 (1926) was a piece of agricultural legislation passed in the United States which expanded upon the Capper\u2013Volstead Act of 1922. It allowed farmers to exchange \u201cpast, present, and prospective crop, market, statistical, economic, and other similar information\u201d at their local cooperative meeting, without breaking antitrust laws. Previously, under the Capper\u2013Volstead Act, they had only been permitted to exchange pricing information.\n\nUnder the Cooperative Marketing Act, farmers and their local, regional, and national cooperatives could legally exchange a host of information within their marketing systems. It was a critically important strategic authorization that enabled federated cooperative systems and marketing agencies-in-common to effectively function as coordinated entities.\n\nIn addition, the Act created the Division of Cooperative Marketing within the United States Department of Agriculture to assist cooperatives in gathering and sharing data on output, prices, and demand. The Act also created the Cooperative Research and Service Division which conducted research and service activities relating to problems of management, organization policies, merchandising, sales, costs, competition, and membership arising in connection with the cooperative marketing of agricultural products and the cooperative purchase of farm supplies and services.\n\nThe Cooperative Marketing act was useful, but it was still not satisfactory to the Farm Bureau or other farm lobbyist groups. For farmers, an increase in available information to help cooperatives work together was no substitute for the price floor on select crops that they demanded. Demand for a price floor was steady, and culminated in the passage of the McNary-Haugen bills in 1927, and again in 1928, both which suffered the veto of President Calvin Coolidge.\n\nMore recently, \"[t]he Treasury Department and the IRS considered a similar but alternative definition of agricultural or horticultural products as agricultural, horticultural, viticultural, and dairy products, livestock and poultry, bees, forest products, fish and shellfish, and any products thereof, including processed and manufactured products, and any and all products raised or produced on farms and any processed or manufactured product thereof within the meaning of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946, 60 Stat. 1091 (1946). While very similar to the definition set forth in these proposed rules, the Treasury Department and the IRS proposed using the definition based on the Cooperative Marketing Act of 1926, which specifically concerns cooperatives, unlike the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946, which concerns the marketing and distribution of agricultural products.\"",

  "Gondor\n\nGondor is a fictional kingdom in J. R. R. Tolkien's writings, described as the greatest realm of Men in the west of Middle-earth at the end of the Third Age. The third volume of The Lord of the Rings, The Return of the King, is largely concerned with the events in Gondor during the War of the Ring and with the restoration of the realm afterward. The history of the kingdom is outlined in the appendices of the book.\n\nGondor was founded by the brothers Isildur and An\u00e1rion, exiles from the downfallen island kingdom of N\u00famenor. Along with Arnor in the north, Gondor, the South-kingdom, served as a last stronghold of the Men of the West. After an early period of growth, Gondor gradually declined as the Third Age progressed, being continually weakened by internal strife and conflict with the allies of the Dark Lord Sauron. By the time of the War of the Ring, the throne of Gondor is empty, though its principalities and fiefdoms still pay deference to the absent king by showing their loyalty to the Stewards of Gondor. The kingdom's ascendancy was restored only with Sauron's final defeat and the crowning of Aragorn as king.\n\nBased upon early conceptions, the history and geography of Gondor were developed in stages as Tolkien extended his legendarium while writing The Lord of the Rings. Critics have noted the contrast between the cultured but lifeless Stewards of Gondor, and the simple but vigorous leaders of the Kingdom of Rohan, modelled on Tolkien's favoured Anglo-Saxons. Scholars have noted parallels between Gondor and the Normans, Ancient Rome, the Vikings, the Goths, the Langobards, and the Byzantine Empire.\n\nIn-fiction etymology\n\nTolkien intended the name Gondor to be Sindarin for \"land of stone\". This is echoed in the text of The Lord of the Rings by the name for Gondor among the Rohirrim, Stoningland. Tolkien's early writings suggest that this was a reference to the highly developed masonry of Gondorians in contrast to their rustic neighbours. This view is supported by the Dr\u00faedain terms for Gondorians and Minas Tirith\u2014Stonehouse-folk and Stone-city. Tolkien denied that the name Gondor had been inspired by the ancient Ethiopian citadel of Gondar, stating that the root Ond went back to an account he had read as a child mentioning ond (\"stone\") as one of only two words known of the pre-Celtic languages of Britain. Gondor is also called the South-kingdom or Southern Realm, and together with Arnor as the N\u00famen\u00f3rean Realms in Exile. Researchers Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull have proposed a Quenya translation of Gondor: Ondon\u00f3r\u00eb. The Men of Gondor are nicknamed \"Tarks\" (from Quenya tarkil \"High Man\", Numenorean) by the orcs of Mordor.\n\nCountry\n\nGondor's geography is illustrated in the maps for The Lord of the Rings made by Christopher Tolkien on the basis of his father's sketches, and geographical accounts in The Rivers and Beacon-Hills of Gondor, Cirion and Eorl, and The Lord of the Rings. Gondor lies in the west of Middle-earth, on the northern shores of Anfalas and the Bay of Belfalas with the great port of Pelargir near the river Anduin's delta in the fertile and populous region of Lebennin, stretching up to the White Mountains (Sindarin: Ered Nimrais, \"Mountains of White Horns\"). Near the mouths of Anduin was the island of Tolfalas.\n\nTo the north-west of Gondor lies Arnor; to the north, Gondor is neighboured by Wilderland and Rohan; to the north-east, by Rh\u00fbn; to the east, across the great river Anduin and the province of Ithilien, by Mordor; to the south, by the deserts of northern Harad. To the west lies the Great Sea.\n\nThe wide land to the west of Rohan was Enedwaith; in some of Tolkien's writings it is part of Gondor, in others not.\n\nThe hot and dry region of South Gondor was by the time of the War of the Rings \"a debatable and desert land\", contested by the men of Harad.\n\nThe region of Lamedon and the uplands of the prosperous Morthond, with the desolate Hill of Erech, lay to the south of the White Mountains, while the populous valleys of Lossarnach were just south of Minas Tirith. The city's port was also a few miles south at Harlond, where the great river Anduin made its closest approach to Minas Tirith. Ringl\u00f3 Vale lay between Lamedon and Lebennin.\n\nThe region of Calenardhon lay to the north of the Grey Mountains; it was granted independence as the kingdom of Rohan. To the northeast, the river Anduin enters the hills of the Emyn Muil and passes the Sarn Gebir, dangerous straits, above a large river-lake, Nen Hithoel. Its entrance was once the northern border of Gondor, and is marked by the Gates of Argonath, an enormous pair of kingly statues, as a warning to trespassers. At the southern end of the lake are the hills of Amon Hen (the Hill of Seeing) and Amon Lhaw (the Hill of Hearing) on the west and east shores; below Amon Hen is the lawn of Parth Galen, where the Fellowship disembarked and was then broken, with the capture of Merry and Pippin, and the death of Boromir. Between the two hills is a rocky islet, Tol Brandir, which partly dams the river; just below it is an enormous waterfall, the Falls of Rauros, over which Boromir's funeral-boat is sent. Further down the river are the hills of Emyn Arnen.\n\nCapital, Minas Tirith\n\nThe capital of Gondor at the end of the Third Age, Minas Tirith (Sindarin: \"Tower of guard\" ), lay at the eastern end of the White Mountains, built around a shoulder of Mount Mindolluin. The city is sometimes called \"the White Tower\", a synecdoche for the city's most prominent building in its Citadel, the seat of the city's administration. The head of government is the Lord of the City, a role fulfilled by the Stewards of Gondor. Other officials included the Warden of the Houses of Healing and the Warden of the Keys. The Warden of the Keys was in charge of the city's security, especially its gates, and the safe-keeping of its treasury, notably the Crown of Gondor; he had full command of the city when it was besieged by the forces of Mordor.\n\nMinas Tirith had seven walls: each wall held a gate, and each gate faced a different direction from the next, facing alternately somewhat north or south. Each level was about 100 ft higher than the one below it, and each surrounded by a high stone wall colored in white, with the exception of the wall of the First Circle (the lowest level), which was black, built of the same material used for Orthanc. This outer wall was also the tallest, longest and strongest of the city's seven walls; it was vulnerable only to earthquakes capable of rending the ground where it stood. The Great Gate of Minas Tirith, constructed of iron and steel and guarded by stone towers and bastions, was the main gate on the first wall level of the city. In front of the Great Gate was a large paved area called the Gateway. The main roads to Minas Tirith met here: the North-way that became the Great West Road to Rohan; the South Road to the southern provinces of Gondor; and the road to Osgiliath, which lay to the north-east of Minas Tirith. Except for the high saddle of rock which joined the west of the hill to Mindolluin, the city was surrounded by the Pelennor, an area of farmlands.\n\nThe city's main street zigzagged up the eastern hill-face and through each of the gates and the central spur of rock. It led to the Citadel through the Seventh Gate on its eastern part. The White Tower, at the city's highest level with a commanding view of the lower vales of Anduin, stood in the Citadel, 700 feet higher than the surrounding plains, protected by the seventh and innermost wall atop the spur. Originally constructed by a king of yore, it is also known as the Tower of Ecthelion, the Steward of Gondor who had it re-built. The seat of the rulers of Gondor, the Kings and the Stewards, the tower stood 300 ft tall, so that its pinnacle was some 1000 ft above the plain. The main doors of the tower faced east, onto the Court of the Fountain. Inside was the Tower Hall, the great throne-room where the Kings (or Stewards) held court. The Seeing-stone of Minas",

  "In Concert 1972\n\nIn Concert 1972 is a double live album by sitar virtuoso Ravi Shankar and sarodya Ali Akbar Khan, released in 1973 on Apple Records. It was recorded at the Philharmonic Hall, New York City, in October 1972, and is a noted example of the two Hindustani classical musicians' celebrated jugalbandi (duet) style of playing. With accompaniment from tabla player Alla Rakha, the performance reflects the two artists' sorrow at the recent death of their revered guru, and Khan's father, Allauddin Khan. The latter was responsible for many innovations in Indian music during the twentieth century, including the call-and-response dialogue that musicians such as Shankar, Khan and Rakha popularised among Western audiences in the 1960s.\n\nThe album features three ragas, including \"Raga Sindhi Bhairavi\", which Ali Akbar Khan had previously interpreted on his landmark 1955 recording Music of India. In Concert 1972 has received critical acclaim; Ken Hunt of Gramophone magazine described it as a \"sometimes smouldering, sometimes fiery, masterpiece\" and \"the living, fire-breathing embodiment of one of the greatest partnerships ever forged in Hindustani [classical music]\".\n\nIn Concert 1972 was produced by George Harrison, Zakir Hussain and Phil McDonald. It was the final Shankar-related release on the Beatles' Apple label, following his and Harrison's work together on Raga and The Concert for Bangladesh. Apple issued In Concert 1972 on CD in 1996 and 2004, reuniting the 50-minute \"Raga Manj Khamaj\", which had previously been split over two LP sides.\n\nBackground\n\nAlong with other leading figures in the field of Hindustani classical music such as Pannalal Ghosh and Annapurna Devi, Ali Akbar Khan and Ravi Shankar trained in the Maihar gharana under Khan and Devi's father, the teacher and multi-instrumentalist Allauddin Khan. Known as \"Baba\", the latter is recognised as one of the great Indian classical music innovators of the twentieth century, having composed up to 600 pieces of music and been responsible for modernising two of its most important string instruments \u2013 the sitar and the sarod. Author Peter Lavazzoli credits Baba's various contributions as having \"shaped... much of what the West knows as Indian classical music\" via Shankar and Khan's subsequent work.\n\nOf the two musicians, Khan, as a master sarodya, was the first to achieve international recognition, with a visit to New York that culminated in his 1955 album Music of India: Morning and Evening Ragas. The latter was the first album of Indian classical music, and its success led to Shankar recording his debut, Three Ragas, in London the following year. While highly regarded as solo artists, Shankar and Khan's duets, known as jugalbandi, were similarly acclaimed from the 1950s onwards. Music critic Ken Hunt writes of the \"tigerish potential for male (sarod) and female (sitar) dialogue\" in their jugalbandi combination. Another Baba legacy was the jawab-sawal (call-and-response) interplay between solo instruments and the twin hand-drum tabla \u2013 a dialogue that Shankar, especially, popularised with Western rock audiences, through his and tabla player Alla Rakha's performances at Monterrey and Woodstock in the late 1960s.\n\nCompared to the more traditional musical path adopted by Khan, Shankar experimented with genres outside Indian classical music and increasingly associated with Western artists, including George Harrison and Philip Glass. Born in East Bengal (now part of Bangladesh), Khan joined Shankar on stage at Madison Square Garden, New York, in August 1971 for the Concert for Bangladesh, organised by Harrison. Just over a year afterwards, on 8 October 1972, Shankar and Khan were recorded at another New York venue, the Philharmonic (now Avery Fisher) Hall, accompanied again by Rakha. Shankar often commented on the warm reception afforded him by audiences in America, where New York had been the first Western city to embrace Indian music.\n\nAs at the Bangladesh shows, there was a poignancy to this 1972 performance, following the death of Allauddin Khan in September that year. As their music guru, Baba had remained a revered figure in their lives, and a man considered a saint in his home town of Maihar. In My Music, My Life, Shankar's 1968 autobiography, he writes admiringly of Baba \"follow[ing] a way of life that was a beautiful fusion of the best of both Hinduism and Islam\", and being similarly broadminded in his musical vision by \"[leading] us away from the confines of narrow specialization that prevailed in our music\". The ensuing duet at the Philharmonic Hall was a passionate musical exchange between Shankar and Khan, a performance that \"far surpasses a tribute frozen in time\", according to Hunt.\n\nRecording\n\nIn a role that he had introduced as an ambassador for Indian classical music, Shankar first addressed the New York audience, to explain what the loss of Allauddin Khan meant to Indian music. He then introduced the first piece, \"Raga Hem Bihag\", as \"one of [Baba's] creations\". As with all the selections, the lead performers received the composer's credit, however, in keeping with Hindustani tradition, which allows for greater improvisation on a recognised composition compared with the more structured Karnatak tradition.\n\nProviding the drone-like accompaniment behind Shankar and Khan during the concert were two tambura players, named as Ashoka and Susan on the album credits. Lavezzoli writes of Shankar's longstanding association with his tabla player that Rakha was \"the ideal partner\", given the drummer's broad training. Continuing Baba's efforts to elevate tabla from its previous, secondary status, Shankar allowed the drums more space in his performances, ensuring that the tabla became recognised as a solo instrument.\n\n\"Hem Bihag\", an evening raga, was followed by a night raga, \"Manj Khamaj\", a piece that had appeared on Shankar's 1970 live album At the Woodstock Festival. The final selection was a morning raga, \"Sindhi Bhairavi\". Khan had recorded this piece as side one of Music of India, and Shankar similarly included it on The Sounds of India, a 1957 album that Lavezzoli describes as \"his own counterpart\" to Khan's debut release.\n\nThe Philharmonic Hall recording became In Concert 1972, made up of the three ragas spread over four LP sides and totalling over 140 minutes of music. An Apple Records release via Shankar's friendship with Harrison, the double album was produced in London by Harrison midway through sessions for his Living in the Material World album. Harrison's co-producers were Rakha's son Zakir Hussain, and sound engineer Phil McDonald.\n\nRelease\n\nApple Records issued In Concert 1972 in January 1973 in the United States (as Apple SVBB 3396), and three months later in Britain (as Apple SAPDO 1002). Billboard magazine carried an Apple trade ad with a tagline beginning: \"Within the small community of Brilliantly Gifted Musicians there exists an even smaller world of Masters. Two of these masters recently joined together in concert \u2026\"\n\nThe double album appeared at the same time as a flurry of other Apple releases, some of them two-record sets also, in the case of Yoko Ono's Approximately Infinite Universe and the Beatles compilations 1962\u20131966 and 1967\u20131970. Despite such an output of product, the label was being wound down from this point on. In Concert 1972 was the final Shankar-related release on Apple Records, following his Joi Bangla EP and Raga film soundtrack and the Concert for Bangladesh triple album, all issued in 1971.\n\nReissue\n\nBy the time In Concert 1972 was available in the UK, in April 1973, Shankar, Harrison, Rakha and Khan's sarod-playing son Aashish were working in Los Angeles on the Shankar Family & Friends album. The latter, which would be a Dark Horse Records release, was remastered and reissued in 2010 as part of the Collaborations box set, at the same time as Shankar's East Meets West Music reissued the equally rare Raga documentary and soundtrack album. In Concert 1972 was not included in these reissue projects, but it was released on CD as part of Apple's 1996\u201397 repackaging campaign. The 2004 two-CD version reunited the two halves of \"Raga Manj Khamaj\".\n\nReception and legacy\n\nOn release, Billboards reviewer described the trio of Shankar, Khan and Rakha as \"[t]he greatest all-star line-up of raga players\" and suggested that the album's \"fiery and hypnotic\" music could make it \"the best-selling raga record of recent years\". Record Mirror said that the LP sleeve's statement regarding a \"meeting of souls\" was an appropriate one, adding that the performance featured \"some quite astonishing technical achievements\" by the musicians.\n\nRough Guides' world music guidebook lists In Concert 1972 among its \"very selective highlights\" of all Shankar's releases, and writes of the live album: \"Pyrotechnics and profundity recorded in New York, matching sitar and sarod in Hindustani music's greatest jugalbandi",

  "System resource\n\nIn computing, a system resource, or simply resource, is any physical or virtual component of limited availability within a computer system. All connected devices and internal system components are resources. Virtual system resources include files (concretely file handles), network connections (concretely network sockets), and memory areas.\n\nManaging resources is referred to as resource management, and includes both preventing resource leaks (not releasing a resource when a process has finished using it) and dealing with resource contention (when multiple processes wish to access a limited resource). Computing resources are used in cloud computing to provide services through networks.\n\nCategories\n\nSome resources, notably memory and storage space, have a notion of \"location\", and one can distinguish contiguous allocations from non-contiguous allocations. For example, allocating 1 GB of memory in a single block, versus allocating it in 1,024 blocks each of size 1 MB. The latter is known as fragmentation, and often severely impacts performance, so contiguous free space is a subcategory of the general resource of storage space.\n\nOne can also distinguish compressible resources from incompressible resources. Compressible resources, generally throughput ones such as CPU and network bandwidth, can be throttled benignly: the user will be slowed proportionally to the throttling, but will otherwise proceed normally. Other resources, generally storage ones such as memory, cannot be throttled without either causing failure (if a process cannot allocate enough memory, it typically cannot run) or severe performance degradation, such as due to thrashing (if a working set does not fit into memory and requires frequent paging, progress will slow significantly). The distinction is not always sharp; as mentioned, a paging system can allow main memory (primary storage) to be compressed (by paging to hard drive (secondary storage)), and some systems allow discardable memory for caches, which is compressible without disastrous performance impact. Electrical power is to some degree compressible: without power (or without sufficient voltage) an electrical device cannot run, and will stop or crash, but some devices, notably mobile phones, can allow degraded operation at reduced power consumption, or can allow the device to be suspended but not terminated, with much lower power consumption.",
  "Alessandro Fersen\n\nAlessandro Fersen (5 December 1911 \u2013 3 October 2001) was a Polish-born Italian dramatist, actor, theater director, author and drama teacher.\n\nBorn Aleksander Fajrajzen in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a to a Jewish family, Fersen he moved to Genoa with his family in 1913. A student under Giuseppe Rensi, in 1934 he graduated in philosophy from the University of Genoa with a thesis later published under the title L'Universo come giuoco (\"The Universe as a game\"). Due to the racial laws of 1938 he moved to Paris (where he attended the Coll\u00e8ge de France) and then in Eastern Europe. Back in Italy in 1943, he participated in the resistance in Liguria, in a partisan group linked to the Italian Socialist Party, before working in Switzerland, where he became friends with Emanuele Luzzati and Giorgio Colli.\n\nHe returned to Italy at the end of World War II, and after a period in which he devoted himself to political activity (being a member of the Secretary of the National Liberation Committee of Genoa and Liguria) and journalism (as a collaborator of newspapers Il Lavoro and Corriere del Popolo), in 1947 he began his activity as a theater director with the drama Leah Lebowitz, a play which he had taken from a Hasidic legend; this play started with the artistic collaboration, which will last decades, with Emanuele Luzzati, with whom founded the \"Teatro Ebraico\" (\"Jewish Theatre\"), staging dramas written by him such as Golem (1969), inspired by the Yiddish folklore, or Leviathan (1974), based on the techniques of mnemodrama. From 1947 Fersen worked for more than a decade for the Teatro Stabile in Genoa, directing adaptations of Shakespeare, Pirandello, Moli\u00e8re, Anouilh, among others. In 1957 he began a career as a drama teacher founding an acting school in Rome, the \"Studio di arti sceniche\", inspired by the Stanislavski's system.

  "Ministry of Social Affairs, Health, Care and Consumer Protection\n\nIn Austrian politics, the Federal Ministry of Social Affairs, Health, Care and Consumer Protection (Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Soziales, Gesundheit, Pflege und Konsumentenschutz) is the ministry in charge of welfare policy.\n\nThe Ministry was first created in 1917 as the Ministry of Social Welfare (Ministerium f\u00fcr soziale F\u00fcrsorge). In its modern form, it dates back to the 1987 establishment of the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (Ministerium f\u00fcr Arbeit und Soziales). From January 2018 to January 2020, the Ministry's official name was Ministry of Labor, Social Affairs, Health, and Consumer Protection (Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Arbeit, Soziales, Gesundheit und Konsumentenschutz). It is responsible for welfare, senior citizens affairs, health care, and consumer policy; it is also charged with stimulating job creation and fighting unemployment. In spite of its official designation, the Ministry is only rarely referred to as the Ministry of Labor (Arbeitsministerium). The moniker does see occasional use, but the traditional short form of Ministry of Social Affairs (Sozialministerium) clearly predominates.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Ministry was first established in 1917 as the Ministry of Social Welfare (Ministerium f\u00fcr soziale F\u00fcrsorge). Created in the final days of World War I, a time of widespread hunger and destitution, it was concerned almost exclusively with pensions and benefits for subjects widowed, crippled, or impoverished by the conflict. After the war, it took control of Austria's developing system of social insurance. Gradually expanding, it existed in more or less its original form until 1987.\n\nAustria did not have a Ministry of Labor, or any other cabinet-level government agency with Labor in its name, for much of its existence. In the decade leading up to the Anschluss and to World War II, implacable hostility between Social Democrats and Christian Conservatives had eroded civil society, undermined democratic institutions, and sparked a civil war; the Christian Social Party eventually manufactured a constitutional crisis that allowed it to replace the Republic of Austria with the Federal State of Austria, a Fascist single-party state. In light of these experiences, Austrian politicians chose to reinvent the country as a consociationalist republic when Nazi Germany had collapsed and Austria, devastated and occupied by the victors, needed to be rebuilt.\n\nFor the first few decades of postwar Austria, its new ethos of consensus decision making was an undisputed success, at least in terms of stability and prosperity. Social Democrats and Conservatism, while still intensely mistrustful of each other's motives and jealous of each other's influence, ruled the country through a series of constructive and mutually beneficial \"grand coalition\" cabinets. The Sozialpartnerschaft, a system of ritualized confrontation and conflict resolution between state-sponsored industrialists' lobbies and state-sponsored workers' unions, essentially dictated social policy to Parliament \u2212 while obviously questionable from a perspective of democratic purism, the system created rapid economic growth, near-full employment, and general social harmony all at the same time. It simply did not occur to either party that a dedicated Ministry of Labor should be necessary to protect workers' interests.\n\nWhen Franz Vranitzky did establish a Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Arbeits und Soziales) in 1987 by extending and renaming the existing Ministry of Social Affairs, the move was a consequence of the decay of the postwar system. The Wirtschaftswunder years were over. Austria's nationalized heavy industries were in trouble. Some of the country's largest employers were in danger; the credibility of the Sozialpartnerschaft was suffering. At the same time, Austria's party landscape was changing: the combined vote share of Social Democrats and People's Party was declining; parliamentarism was becoming more vigorous and assertive. It was clear that future cabinets were going to have to take charge of employment policy and workers' welfare more directly and with more parliamentary accountability.\n\nIn 1997, the Klima cabinet dissolved the Ministry of Health and Consumer Protection and transferred its responsibilities in matters of health care to what was now called the Ministry of Labor, Health, and Social Affairs (Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Arbeit, Gesundheit und Soziales). The Chancellery was put in charge of consumer protection.\n\nA few years and one election later, in 2003, the Sch\u00fcssel I cabinet split the Ministry into three: Labor was attached to the Ministry of Economy. Social Affairs became a ministry in its own right again; Health became a standalone ministry as well. The new Ministry of Health was also in charge of family affairs; the Ministry of Social Affairs took back consumer protection from the Chancellery. A few years later, in 2009, responsibilities were shuffled again: the Faymann cabinet removed labor affairs from the Ministry of Economy, creating an independent Ministry of Labor once again; Labor then absorbed Social Affairs.\n\nIn 2018, the Ministry also absorbed the Ministry of Health. On 29 January 2020, it was renamed Federal Ministry of Social Affairs, Health, Care and Consumer Protection.\n\nStructure\n\nAs of May 2018, the ministry consists of the Minister and his personal staff (Kabinett), the office of the director general (Generalsekret\u00e4r), and ten numbered regular departments (Sektionen):\n\nThe Minister and his staff are political appointees; the director general and the section heads are career civil servants.",

  "Nicholas Monsarrat\n\nLieutenant Commander Nicholas John Turney Monsarrat FRSL RNVR (22 March 1910 \u2013 8 August 1979) was a British novelist known for his sea stories, particularly The Cruel Sea (1951) and Three Corvettes (1942\u201345), but perhaps known best internationally for his novels, The Tribe That Lost Its Head and its sequel, Richer Than All His Tribe.\n\nEarly life\n\nMonsarrat was born on Rodney Street in Liverpool, Lancashire, to parents Keith Waldegrave Monsarrat FRCS (among the most eminent surgeons of his time) and Marguerite Turney. Monsarrat was educated at Winchester College and Trinity College, Cambridge. In his autobiography, he wrote that the 1931 Invergordon Naval Mutiny influenced his interest in politics and social and economic issues after college.\n\nHe had intended to practise law, but decided to pursue working as an author instead. He moved to London and wrote as a freelancer for newspapers. He wrote four novels and a play in the space of five years (1934\u20131939).\n\nWartime service\n\nThough critical of military violence, Monsarrat served during World War II, first as a member of an ambulance brigade and then as a member of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR). His lifelong love of sailing made him a capable naval officer, and he served with distinction in a series of small warships (corvettes and frigates), assigned to escort convoys and protect them from enemy attack. Monsarrat ended the war as commander of a frigate, and drew on his wartime experience in his postwar sea stories.\n\nResigning his wartime commission during 1946, Monsarrat entered the diplomatic service. He was posted at first to Johannesburg, South Africa and then, in 1953, to Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. He began writing full-time during 1959, settling first on Guernsey, in the Channel Islands, and later on the Maltese island of Gozo.\n\nPosts\n\n\"HMS Flower\" and \"HMS Compass Rose\" were fictional Flower-class corvettes in the short story H M Corvette (1942) and the novel The Cruel Sea (1951)\n\n\"HMS Dipper\" and \"HMS Winger\" were fictional Kingfisher-class corvettes in the stories East Coast Corvette (1943) and Corvette Command (1944), (republished with H M Corvette as Three Corvettes in 1945).\n\n\"HMS River\" and \"HMS Saltash\" were fictional River-class frigates in H M Frigate (1946), and the novel The Cruel Sea (1951). (In the 1953 film version HMS Saltash was depicted by :, and hence named \"Saltash Castle\").\n\nWork\n\nMonsarrat's first three novels, published during 1934\u20131937 and now out of print, were realistic treatments of modern social problems informed by his leftist politics. The Visitor, his only play, was in the same category. His fourth novel and first major work, This Is the Schoolroom, had a different theme. The story of a young, idealistic, aspiring writer experiencing the \"real world\" for the first time, it is at least partly autobiographical.\n\nThe Cruel Sea (1951), Monsarrat's first postwar novel, is widely regarded as his best work: It is the only one of his novels that is still read widely. Based on his own wartime service, it concerned the young naval officer Keith Lockhart during a series of postings in corvettes and frigates. It was one of the first novels to depict life aboard the vital, but unglamorous, \"small ships\" of World War II \u2014 ships for which the sea was as much a threat as the enemy. Monsarrat's short-story collections HMS Marlborough Will Enter Harbour (1949), and The Ship That Died of Shame (1959, made into a movie of the same name), had the same theme and gained popularity by association with The Cruel Sea.\n\nThe similar Three Corvettes (1945 and 1953) comprising HM Corvette (set aboard a Flower-class corvette in the North Atlantic), East Coast Corvette (as First Lieutenant of HMS Guillemot) and Corvette Command (as Commanding Officer of ) is actually an anthology of three true-experience stories he published during the war years and shows appropriate care for what the Censor might say. Thus Guillemot has the pseudonym Dipper and Shearwater the pseudonym Winger in the book. HM Frigate is similar but deals with his time in command of two frigates. His use of the name Dipper could allude to his formative years when summer holidays were spent with his family at Trearddur Bay. They were members of the famous sailing club based there, and he recounted much of this part of his life in a book My Brother Denys. Denys Monsarrat was killed in Egypt during the middle part of the war whilst his brother was serving with the Royal Navy. Another tale recounts his bringing his ship into Trearddur Bay during the war for old times' sake.\n\nMonsarrat's more famous novels, notably The Tribe That Lost Its Head (1956) and its sequel Richer Than All His Tribe (1968), draw on his experience in the diplomatic service and make important reference to the colonial experience of Britain in Africa. Several have peripheral associations with the sea: The Nylon Pirates (1960) tells a story of crime aboard a modern ocean liner, not pirates in the traditional meaning of the word, but card-sharps, and A Fair Day's Work (1964) deals with labour unrest in a shipyard. The Kappillan of Malta (1973) is as much a story of a place, the island of Malta, as it is of a priest on that island during World War II.\n\nHis book The Story of Esther Costello (1952), later made into a movie of the same name, while perceived as an uncomplimentary description of the life of Helen Keller and her teachers and assistants, is really an expos\u00e9 of sleazy practices and exploitation of real causes in the fundraising racket, similar to criticisms of televangelism. It caused a minor public outcry when it first appeared, and Keller's staff considered suing him, then tried to limit the distribution of the book.\n\nHis final work, unfinished at the time of his death but published in its incomplete form, was a two-volume historical novel titled The Master Mariner. Based on the legend of the Wandering Jew, it told the story of a 16th-century English seaman who, as punishment for a terrible act of cowardice, is doomed to sail the world's seas until the end of time. His hero participates in critical moments in history; Monsarrat used him to emphasize the importance of seamen.\n\nAutobiography\n\nTwo non-fiction books, Life is a Four Letter Word: Breaking In (London, 1966) and Life is a Four Letter Word: Breaking Out (London, 1970), comprise Monsarrat's autobiography.\n\nDeath\n\nNicholas Monsarrat died of cancer on 8 August 1979 in London. The Royal Navy co-operated with his wish to be buried at sea. The two naval ratings responsible for the lifting of the casket at his burial were AB Graham Savage and AB Stephen Knight, aboard HMS Scylla.",

  "Nazca Ridge\n\nThe Nazca Ridge is a submarine ridge, located on the Nazca Plate off the west coast of South America. This plate and ridge are currently subducting under the South American Plate at a convergent boundary known as the Peru-Chile Trench at approximately 7.7 cm per year. The Nazca Ridge began subducting obliquely to the collision margin at 11\u00b0S, approximately 11.2 Ma, and the current subduction location is 15\u00b0S. The ridge is composed of abnormally thick basaltic ocean crust, averaging 18 \u00b13 km thick. This crust is buoyant, resulting in flat slab subduction under Peru. This flat slab subduction has been associated with the uplift of Pisco Basin and the cessation of Andes volcanism and the uplift of the Fitzcarrald Arch on the South American continent approximately 4 Ma.\n\nMorphology\n\nThe Nazca Ridge is approximately 200 km wide, 1100 km long, and has 1500 m of bathymetric relief. The gradient of the slopes is 1-2 degrees. The ridge is located at a depth of 4000 m below sea level, above the carbonate compensation depth. It is blanketed in a thin covering of 300 to 400 m thick pelagic calcareous ooze. Based on Rayleigh wave analysis, the ridge has an average crustal thickness of 18 \u00b13 km, but could have a localized maximum thickness up to 35 km. This is abnormally thick for oceanic crust. By comparison, the underlying Nazca Plate adjacent to the ridge ranges from 6 to 8 km thick, and is comparable to the worldwide average of around 7 km thick.\n\nFormation\n\nBased on basalt ages, the portion of the Nazca Ridge that is currently exposed dates from 31 \u00b1 1 Ma at the Peru-Chile trench, to 23 \u00b1 1 Ma where the Nazca Ridge and Easter Seamount Chain are adjacent. Basalt composition has also been used to show that the Nazca Ridge and Easter Seamount Chain formed from the same magma source, with the formation of the Easter Seamount Chain occurring after the Nazca Plate changed direction. Formation began along the Pacific-Farallon/Nazca spreading center, and has been attributed to hot spot volcanism. There is some debate as to where this hot spot was originally located however, with locations near Easter Island and Salas y Gomez both being proposed. The ridge is primarily composed of mid-ocean ridge basalt, which erupted on the Nazca Plate when the plate was already 5-13 Ma old. Based on isotopic ratios and rare earth element composition, it is estimated that the magma was sourced at approximately 95 km depth from a 7% partial melt. The Nazca Ridge has a conjugate feature on the Pacific Plate, the Tuamotu Plateau. Magnetic anomalies have shown that there was symmetrical spreading at the Pacific-Farallon/Nazca center, so the Tuamotu Plateau can be used as a proxy for the pre-subducted Nazca Ridge geometry.\n\nSubduction and migration history\n\nThe Nazca Plate began subducting into the Peru-Chile trench 11.2 Ma at 11\u00b0S. Due to the oblique orientation of the ridge to the Nazca-South American plate collision zone, the ridge has migrated south along the active margin to its current location at 15\u00b0S. Based on Tuamotu Plateau mirror relationship, it is estimated that 900 km of the Nazca Ridge has already subducted. The speed of migration has slowed over time, with the ridge migrating at 7.5 cm per year until 10.8 Ma, then slowing to 6.1 cm per year from 10.8-4.9 Ma. The current ridge migration rate is 4.3 cm per year. The current plate subduction rate is 7.7 cm per year.\n\nContinental margin interaction\n\nThe ridge is buoyant, resulting in flat slab subduction of the Nazca Plate underneath Peru. Buoyancy is related to crustal age, and the buoyancy effect can be seen in oceanic crust aged from 30-40 Ma. The Nazca Plate is dated to 45 Ma where it subducts into the Peru-Chile trench. The extreme thickness of the buoyant ridge is responsible for the flat slab subduction of the older underlying plate. Modeling has shown that this type of subduction is only concurrent with submarine ridges, and accounts for approximately 10% of convergent boundaries. The most recent estimate of the subduction angle for the Nazca Plate is 20\u00b0 to a depth of 24 km at 110 km inland. At 80 km depth, approximately 220 km inland, the plate shifts to a horizontal orientation, and continues to travel horizontally for up to 700 km inland, before resuming subduction into the asthenosphere.\n\nLarge magnitude earthquakes occur in association with the area around the Nazca Ridge subduction zone, known at the Peru megathrust. These include, but are not limited to, a magnitude 8.1 earthquake in 1942, a magnitude 8.0 earthquake in 1970, a magnitude 7.7 earthquake in 1996, a magnitude 8.4 earthquake in 2001, and a magnitude 8.0 earthquake in 2007. Earthquake records for this area of subduction go back to 1586. All of these ruptures were located either on the coast of Peru or within the Peru-Chile Trench between 9\u00b0S and 18\u00b0S, coincidental with the subducting Nazca Ridge, and include both intraplate and interplate rupturing. No large earthquakes have been located between 14\u00b0S and 15.5\u00b0S, where the bathymetric high of the ridge is subducting. Interplate earthquakes do not occur in direct conjunction with the Nazca Ridge.\n\nThere has been little geomorphic affect to the Peru-Chile trench due to the ridge subduction beyond a shallowing from 6500 to 5000 m above the ridge location. However, this is a tectonic erosion margin. There is no accretionary wedge forming in the trench, and what sediment is found there is from continental sources, based on fossil assemblage. The calcareous ooze blanketing Nazca Ridge is completely subducted. Crustal erosion of the forearc basin has resulted in the loss of 110 km of the South American Plate since 11 Ma.\n\nThe forearc basin of Pisco located above the subducting ridge has experienced uplift since the Late Pliocene or Pleistocene an uplift that is attributed to the subduction of the Nazca Ridge.\n\nInfluence in Amazon tectonics\n\nThe flat slab subduction associated with the Nazca Ridge has been linked to the cessation of volcanism in the Andes Mountains at about 4 Ma. The subduction has also been linked with the formation of the Fitzcarrald Arch, which is a 400000 km2, 400 to 600 m high, domed topographic feature that defines the Amazon drainage Basin. Studies indicate that the uplift of the arch also began 4 Ma.\n\nThe uplift of the Fitzcarrald Arch intersects with the Andes Mountains where there is a shift from high-gradient topography to the low-gradient Amazon Basin. This topographic uplift effectively divides the Amazon drainage basin into three sub-basins, the Ucayali to the northwest, the Acre to the northeast, and the Madre De Dios to the southeast. It's hypothesized that significant modifications to sedimentary, erosional, and hydrological processes have resulted from the uplift of the Fitzcarrald Arch. Evolutionary paths for freshwater fish began to diverge in the Amazon sub-basins approximately 4 Ma as well. The uplift of the Fitzcarrald Arch could also be the catalyst that lead to these differing evolutionary paths, effectively isolating fish populations from each other.",

The company operates around 200 newspapers and websites around the United Kingdom.\n\nFormation\n\nOn 17 November 2018, a spokesperson for Johnston Press announced that all its titles had been transferred to the control of JPIMedia, a special purpose vehicle (SPV), owned by the creditors. Under the terms of the pre-packaged deal, ownership passed to a consortium of four lenders \u2013 CarVal, Fidelity, Benefit Street Partners and Goldentree Asset Management \u2013 who reduced its debts to \u00a385 million and injected \u00a335 million investment. This however was subject to criticism by Johnston Press's largest shareholder, described as a \"blatant pre-planned corporate theft by bondholders\", and was raised in Parliament.\n\n2019 asset sales\n\nIt was reported in May 2019, that a group of bondholders led by GoldenTree Asset Management has appointed bankers at Stella EOC to lay the groundwork for a potential sale of part, or all, of the business.\n\nIn July 2019, it was confirmed that a sale process of JPIMedia was taking place.\n\nReach plc were said to be \"early stages\" of talks to buy \"certain assets\" from JPI Media. In November 2019, it was announced that the i had been sold to Daily Mail and General Trust.\n\nIn February 2020, it was announced that JPIMedia are no longer exploring a sale of their assets excluding the sale of the i which is subject to regulatory approval.\n\nSale to National World\n\nOn 31 December 2020, it was announced that JPIMedia Publishing Ltd and its subsidiaries was being sold to National World plc on 2 January 2021. The new company was set up by the media executive David Montgomery.\n\nOperations\n\nSince the acquisition of JPIMedia Publishing, National World Plc has expanded its footprint into all the major metropolitan centres in the UK.\n\nHaving successfully launched a new national newspaper online, Nationalworld.com, the group has been launching new websites in Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle, Glasgow, London, Birmingham, Bristol and Wales.\n\nTogether with its JPI Media newspaper brands this will give the company immediate access to 80 percent of the UK market. Nationalworld.com will join the eight new sites in a new \u201cWorld\u201d division for the business. For the first time the publishing technology and content management system will be digital-led with no need to offer parallel publishing services for print titles.\n\nNewspapers in Great Britain\n\nThe following is a partial list of British newspapers owned by the company:\n\nNewspapers in Northern Ireland\n\nJPIMedia publishes a total of 22 titles in Northern Ireland through two holding companies, JPIMedia NI and Derry Journal Newspapers. The geographic readership of some titles extends across the Irish border into the Republic of Ireland, such as the Derry Journal which also covers County Donegal. Former JPIMedia titles published in the Republic of Ireland now belong to Iconic Newspapers.\n\nOnline\n\nThe company owns the following websites, in addition to newspaper sites as above, and regionalised versions of these:",

  "Gilles J. Guillemin\n\nGilles J. Guillemin (born January 1967) is a French-Australian neuroscientist at Macquarie University. He received the Ordre national du M\u00e9rite in 2019 in recognition of his work in medical research. He was awarded a Member of the Order of Australia in 2021.\n\nLife\n\nBorn in Dijon, France in January 1967, Guillemin moved to Australia in 1997 to pursue post-doctoral studies after he obtained a PhD in Neurovirology from the University of Burgundy.\n\nCareer\n\nGuillemin has been working in the field of Neuroimmunology since then, with a focus on tryptophan metabolism research.\n\nGuillemin started his career as a Senior Research Scientist at St Vincent's Private Hospital (1997-2003), then he became an Associate Professor at the University of New South Wales (2003-2012).\n\nIn 2011, he was involved in the founding of The Motor Neurone Disease (MND) Research Centre at Macquarie University. He was co-director of the centre from 2011 to 2016. As part of his work at the centre, Guillemin and his group study \"the involvement of tryptophan in MND\" and focus on neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity.\n\nGuillemin has been studying the involvement of tryptophan catabolism (via the kynurenine pathway- KP B) in human neurodegenerative diseases for more than 20 years. Guillemin and his teams have conducted research that demonstrates the importance of the KP in multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and motor neuron disease, which has diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic potential. This research has been extended to looking at the chemicals in the brain and their relation to other diseases such as depression, suicide, autism and cancers.\n\nGuillemin is part of a research group working on neuroactive (toxic or protective) metabolites derived from tryptophan.\n\nAs a result of their research, the team has identified a \"new process for the uptake of the neurotoxin quinolinic acid (QUIN) in human neurons that could reduce the impact of major inflammatory diseases\". The study built on the results of previous research by Guillemin that demonstrated excessive amounts of QUIN accumulate within the human brain of Alzheimer\u2019s and motor neuron disease (MND) patients.\n\nAs an extension of his research on tryptophan and QUIN, Guillemin has also conducted research into Multiple Sclerosis (MS), including a project that discovered the first blood biomarker for MS. The result of the project was the identification of a biomarker that can discriminate between the three subtypes of MS with 85-90 percent accuracy, allowing for a more accurate diagnosis of MS in patients.\n\nGuillemin has been the Editor-in-Chief of The International Journal on Tryptophan Research since 2008.\n\nHe was appointed as a Professor of Neuroscience at Macquarie University in 2012.\n\nIn 2020, the editors of PLOS ONE retracted an article co-authored by Guillemin, citing concerns about the integrity of some of its data.\n\nPandis\n\nIn 2018, Guillemin co-created PANDIS with Catherine Stace. PANDIS is an Australian not-for-profit organisation.\n\nThe aim of the organisation is to identify \"infectious pathogens in Australian patients with various types of chronic diseases,\" called PAN for \"All\" and DIS for \"diseases\", with a focus on tick-borne diseases.\n\nMotor Neurone Disease BioBank\n\nIn 2012, Guillemin, with his colleague Dominic Rowe, co-created the first motor neuoron disease biobank in Australia.\n\nThe Motor Neurone Disease (MND) Biobank houses samples that are then available to for use in research projects. One such project was conducted by Guillemin and his team around the analysis of the blood plasma of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients to find ways to improve diagnosis.\n\nCommunity engagement\n\nGuillemin was involved in \"STEM Professionals in Schools\" a CSIRO Education program where he shares his experience as a scientist to primary and secondary school students, from 2009 to 2017.\n\nSports\n\nGuillemin was a member of the Australian Men's Handball Team from 2003 to 2005.

  "Geochronology\n\nGeochronology is the science of determining the age of rocks, fossils, and sediments using signatures inherent in the rocks themselves. Absolute geochronology can be accomplished through radioactive isotopes, whereas relative geochronology is provided by tools such as paleomagnetism and stable isotope ratios. By combining multiple geochronological (and biostratigraphic) indicators the precision of the recovered age can be improved.\n\nGeochronology is different in application from biostratigraphy, which is the science of assigning sedimentary rocks to a known geological period via describing, cataloging and comparing fossil floral and faunal assemblages. Biostratigraphy does not directly provide an absolute age determination of a rock, but merely places it within an interval of time at which that fossil assemblage is known to have coexisted. Both disciplines work together hand in hand, however, to the point where they share the same system of naming strata (rock layers) and the time spans utilized to classify sublayers within a stratum.\n\nThe science of geochronology is the prime tool used in the discipline of chronostratigraphy, which attempts to derive absolute age dates for all fossil assemblages and determine the geologic history of the Earth and extraterrestrial bodies.\n\nRadiometric dating\n\nBy measuring the amount of radioactive decay of a radioactive isotope with a known half-life, geologists can establish the absolute age of the parent material. A number of radioactive isotopes are used for this purpose, and depending on the rate of decay, are used for dating different geological periods. More slowly decaying isotopes are useful for longer periods of time, but less accurate in absolute years. With the exception of the radiocarbon method, most of these techniques are actually based on measuring an increase in the abundance of a radiogenic isotope, which is the decay-product of the radioactive parent isotope. Two or more radiometric methods can be used in concert to achieve more robust results. Most radiometric methods are suitable for geological time only, but some such as the radiocarbon method and the 40Ar/39Ar dating method can be extended into the time of early human life and into recorded history.\n\nSome of the commonly used techniques are:\n\nCosmogenic nuclide geochronology\n\nA series of related techniques for determining the age at which a geomorphic surface was created (exposure dating), or at which formerly surficial materials were buried (burial dating). Exposure dating uses the concentration of exotic nuclides (e.g. 10Be, 26Al, 36Cl) produced by cosmic rays interacting with Earth materials as a proxy for the age at which a surface, such as an alluvial fan, was created. Burial dating uses the differential radioactive decay of 2 cosmogenic elements as a proxy for the age at which a sediment was screened by burial from further cosmic rays exposure.\n\nLuminescence dating\n\nLuminescence dating techniques observe 'light' emitted from materials such as quartz, diamond, feldspar, and calcite. Many types of luminescence techniques are utilized in geology, including optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), cathodoluminescence (CL), and thermoluminescence (TL). Thermoluminescence and optically stimulated luminescence are used in archaeology to date 'fired' objects such as pottery or cooking stones and can be used to observe sand migration.\n\nIncremental dating\n\nIncremental dating techniques allow the construction of year-by-year annual chronologies, which can be fixed (i.e. linked to the present day and thus calendar or sidereal time) or floating.\n\nPaleomagnetic dating\n\nA sequence of paleomagnetic poles (usually called virtual geomagnetic poles), which are already well defined in age, constitutes an apparent polar wander path (APWP). Such a path is constructed for a large continental block. APWPs for different continents can be used as a reference for newly obtained poles for the rocks with unknown age. For paleomagnetic dating, it is suggested to use the APWP in order to date a pole obtained from rocks or sediments of unknown age by linking the paleopole to the nearest point on the APWP. Two methods of paleomagnetic dating have been suggested: (1) the angular method and (2) the rotation method. The first method is used for paleomagnetic dating of rocks inside of the same continental block. The second method is used for the folded areas where tectonic rotations are possible.\n\nMagnetostratigraphy\n\nMagnetostratigraphy determines age from the pattern of magnetic polarity zones in a series of bedded sedimentary and/or volcanic rocks by comparison to the magnetic polarity timescale. The polarity timescale has been previously determined by dating of seafloor magnetic anomalies, radiometrically dating volcanic rocks within magnetostratigraphic sections, and astronomically dating magnetostratigraphic sections.\n\nChemostratigraphy\n\nGlobal trends in isotope compositions, particularly carbon-13 and strontium isotopes, can be used to correlate strata.\n\nCorrelation of marker horizons\n\nMarker horizons are stratigraphic units of the same age and of such distinctive composition and appearance that, despite their presence in different geographic sites, there is certainty about their age-equivalence. Fossil faunal and floral assemblages, both marine and terrestrial, make for distinctive marker horizons. Tephrochronology is a method for geochemical correlation of unknown volcanic ash (tephra) to geochemically fingerprinted, dated tephra. Tephra is also often used as a dating tool in archaeology, since the dates of some eruptions are well-established.\n\nGeological hierarchy of chronological periodization\n\nGeochronology, from largest to smallest:\n\nDifferences from chronostratigraphy\n\nIt is important not to confuse geochronologic and chronostratigraphic units. Geochronological units are periods of time, thus it is correct to say that Tyrannosaurus rex lived during the Late Cretaceous Epoch. Chronostratigraphic units are geological material, so it is also correct to say that fossils of the genus Tyrannosaurus have been found in the Upper Cretaceous Series. In the same way, it is entirely possible to go and visit an Upper Cretaceous Series deposit \u2013 such as the Hell Creek deposit where the Tyrannosaurus fossils were found \u2013 but it is naturally impossible to visit the Late Cretaceous Epoch as that is a period of time.",

  "Royal Latin School\n\nThe Royal Latin School (RLS) is a co-educational grammar school in Buckingham, England, with one of the most distinguished histories as a grammar school in the country. It has continually existed for almost six hundred years; receiving a Royal Charter in this time and moving premises three times. In September 2011 the school became an academy. It takes children from the age of 11 through to the age of 18 and has over 1260 pupils, including a sixth form of 390 pupils. It maintains a staff of just over 160. In September 2003 the school was designated by the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) as a specialist school in science. It was successfully redesignated in 2007 and achieved a second specialism as a training school.\n\nSince the county's boundary adjustments of 1974 placed Eton College in Berkshire, the Royal Latin School claims the distinction of being the sole pre-Reformation grammar school in the county. The Royal Latin School was graded as outstanding in the 2009 report by Ofsted.\n\nHistory\n\nThe school's earlist recorded reference occurs in 1423. A very small establishment at first, the school taught only six poor boys.\n\nAlthough Buckingham's citizens supported Catherine of Aragon and her daughter Mary Tudor, and were opposed to the Reformation, the Chantry Chapel in which the Royal Latin School was based, rather than being destroyed by Edward VI (as many similar establishments were) was instead converted into the Royal Latin School. King Edward VI granted a charter for the school, for 30-40 pupils, in 1548 with an endowment of \u00a310 and with 12 trustees. A major fire in 1696 destroyed the Master's House which was rebuilt by Alexander Denton, complete with a garden.\n\nThe Chantry Chapel dedicated to St John the Baptist and Thomas a Beckett had an original Romanesque doorway, it served as the main schoolroom. Early 19th century Master was Oxford-educated aristocrat Rev William Eyre, MA vicar of Padbury. It remained the home of the Royal Latin School until 1907 when Buckinghamshire County Council provided major new buildings for the school in Chandos Road, now the site of Grenville School and did so again in 1963, when the school moved to Brookfield House, formerly The Mount. Numerous extensions in 1963 were opened by Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, with further extensions being gradually added over the next few decades. The warm brown brickwork of the 1963 extensions complements the stone-built structure of the earlier buildings, the whole is enhanced by its parkland setting on the outskirts of Buckingham. Brookfield House and its grounds have been expanded over recent years to accommodate the growing size of the school and the fact that many of the older buildings, given the larger number of students, were becoming inadequate for use on such a large scale.\n\nIn 2006, the U15 rugby side made school history by becoming the first side from the Royal Latin to reach the semi-finals of the Daily Mail Vase, the English schools' annual rugby union cup competition. The U15s surpassed this record in 2013 reaching the final at Twickenham Stadium, where they beat Felsted School 19-13 to win the vase. The U13 girls' team (rugby) won girls nationals in 2015 and were unbeaten in the 2017-18 season.\n\nIn 2015, the first of three projects known as the 'RLS 600 Campaign'was completed. This was a two-storey science laboratory with 13 classrooms for expanding further the knowledge of sciences for the students. The next two projects will be a Sports Campus, and an Arts department, built before the 600th anniversary of the Royal Latin, in 2023.\n\nIn February 2017, a 'no phone' policy was introduced to the school.\n\nSchool buildings\n\nBrookfield House: Formerly the boys' boarding house. A former hunting lodge, once frequented by King Charles III, that houses the school offices and reception, the school library, conference room, art department, music department and some science and drama laboratories and rooms.\n\nRotherfield House: Formerly the girls' boarding house. A lodge that houses the Sixth Form classrooms, common room, etc., in addition to the school lecture theatre, school archives, a computer suite and alumni rooms and offices.\n\nMain Block: Built-in 1963 by Fred Pooley CBE, this houses the school hall, old gymnasium, stage (both indoor and outdoor) and drama department, student reception, school offices, English department, humanities department and the dining room.\n\nTechnology Block: Also built-in 1963 by the same architect, this houses the technology department, including cooking rooms, wood and metal workshops and classrooms.\n\nFormer Science Block: Now used by the SCITT for teaching training.\n\nNew Block: This building, built-in 2001, houses the mathematics department, the languages department, the economics and business studies department and some science laboratories.\n\nSports Hall: Built-in 2003 on the site of the headmaster's garden outside Brookfield House, this houses the PE department which also use the old gym.\n\nDiscovery Centre: A 12-classroom building dedicated to the sciences that also contains conference rooms, completed in 2015, as part one of the 600 campaign. The building was officially opened on 2 October 2015 by Robert Winston and John Bercow.\n\nThe school regularly uses the church of St Peter and St Paul's in Buckingham for its annual carol service and Founder's Day service, which is held on the feast day of St John, the patron saint of the school. The church is also used for various concerts throughout the year.\n\nThe Chantry Chapel, the school's former chapel, is now owned by the National Trust and is too small to accommodate the entire school, thus necessitating the transfer of all school religious ceremonies to the parish church.\n\nHouses\n\nEach pupil, upon entrance, is placed into one of six houses, named after founders of the school at various stages in its history. The six houses are:\n\nUniform\n\nYears seven to eleven: School blazer, black trousers, black skirt for girls, black socks/tights, white regulation shirt, school tie (red, black and house colour) and black shoes. A black v-neck jumper may be worn.\n\nSixth Form: Smart clothing, matching dark suits with a jacket for girls and shirt and tie for boys.",
  "SS San Wilfrido (1914)\n\nSS San Wilfrido was a steam-powered British tanker that was launched in February 1914 and sunk by a German mine less than six months later. Armstrong, Whitworth & Co Ltd built her on the River Tyne for the Eagle Oil Transport Co Ltd.\n\nSan Wilfrido struck the mine in the North Sea on 3 August 1914, one day before Britain declared war on Germany. She was Britain's first naval loss of the First World War.\n\nThis was the first of two Eagle Oil tankers to be called San Wilfrido. The second was the Empire ship, which Eagle Oil bought and renamed Sain Wilfrido in 1946.\n\nBuilding\n\nArmstrong, Whitworth & Co Ltd built San Wilfrido at Low Walker as yard number 856. She was launched on 11February 1914 and completed in April 1914.\n\nSan Wilfrido was the third of four sister ships. In 1913 Armstrong Whitworth built San Urbano and Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company built San Valerio. In 1914 Palmer's launched San Zeferino the day after Armstrong, Whitworth launched San Wilfrido.\n\nSan Wilfrido was 420.3 ft long, with a beam of 54.7 ft and a depth of 32.6 ft. Her tonnages were, and. She had a single screw, powered by a quadruple expansion engine built by the Wallsend Slipway & Engineering Company Ltd, Wallsend. It was rated at 554 nhp and gave San Wilfrido a speed of 11 kn.\n\nSan Wilfridos UK official number was 136658 and her code letters were JFHC.\n\nHistory\n\nSan Wilfrido made trips with usually 8,000 tonnes of oil out of her tonnage of 9,000. The ship was sunk just four months after her completion.\n\nSinking\n\nOn 3 August 1914 San Wilfrido was sailing from Hamburg to Portland in ballast. The trip was expected to take two and a half days, after which she would sail for New Orleans.\n\nWhile navigating the Elbe about eight miles above Brunsb\u00fcttel she was given permission to proceed until Cuxhaven at the mouth of the North Sea. No pilot vessel was available to take her through the minefield at Cuxhaven so she tried to proceed on her own along the usual channel. Tugboat men of the harbour tried to warn San Wilfrido's master of the danger by shouting. The master then tried to evade the mines by attempting to go full speed astern. However, at about 4 p.m., a strong ebb tide carried San Wilfrido into the mines. Three explosions followed and crippled the ship making her the first British naval loss of the war. A German tug took the crew away as internees.\n\nThe British Consul-General in Antwerp was informed and he in turn notified the British Admiralty. The information was passed on to Lloyd's of London. When the news of the ship's sinking arrived to Britain four days later, on 7 August, Britain was already at war with Germany.\n\nMost of her 44-strong crew were from Tyneside, with three or four believed to be from London. Her Master was Captain CH Williams of Cardiff. The crew was interned and had to survive on raw herring for two days until they were transferred to Ruhleben internment camp.\n\nSan Wilfrido carried a Marconi Company wireless telegraphy installation. Ben Baxter, one of her wireless operators, made a model ship of San Wilfrido while interned, and after the war he submitted it to the Ruhleben Exhibition at Central Hall Westminster. The model is now in the collections of the Imperial War Museum in London.\n\nThe wreck was removed from Cuxhaven in September 1920.",

  "SMS Gefion (1843)\n\nSMS Gefion was a sailing frigate, originally serving the Danish Navy. In 1849, during the First Schleswig War, she fell into the hands of Schleswig-Holstein under the name of Eckernf\u00f6rde. The ship joined the Reichsflotte in 1850. When it was dissolved in 1852, Prussia bought her for its navy and her old name was restored.\n\nDanish service\n\nGefion was commissioned on 6 May 1844. On her first voyage, starting on 23 May, she took the crown prince, the future Frederick VII of Denmark, to the Faroe Islands, then went to the Mediterranean and Morocco, finally taking on board works of art by the late sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen in Livorno. On November 16, she arrived back in Copenhagen with them. In 1846, again with the crown prince on board, she visited Funchal and Cadiz.\n\nIn mid-May 1848, Gefion was equipped for the Schleswig-Holstein War. Until the end of October 1848, she and other ships blockaded the mouth of the Elbe. After the armistice expired in 1849, she was part of the Danish fleet (7 ships with 147 guns together) that was to fight down the beach batteries (three batteries with 16 guns together) at Eckernf\u00f6rde.\n\nIn the engagement at Eckernf\u00f6rde on 5 April 1849, the shelling of the coastal batteries at Eckernf\u00f6rde succeeded in forcing the frigate's crew to surrender. She had commenced the attack at about 7:00 in the morning, but due to unfavorable wind conditions was only maneuverable with towing assistance from the steamer Geiser. At about 8:00, the towing cables were cut by shelling. All further attempts to tow the ship failed due to the shelling. Anchored near the beach, the ship was unable to leave the bay again due to the unfavorable wind under fire and surrendered at about 6:00 in the evening. After the abandonment of the heavily damaged frigate, the ship was initially taken under the then neutral Prussian flag until the question of ownership was finally clarified, but had already been renamed SMS Eckernf\u00f6rde. On September 12, 1850, the Danes attempted to recapture ger, which had been repaired in Eckernf\u00f6rde harbor. When this failed, an attempt was made to destroy her by setting her on fire. The ship would have been lost had the crew obeyed the order of the English captain and abandoned the ship. However, First Officer Thaulow and Second Officer Neynaber refused the order to abandon ship and were able to save the ship with the support of the entire crew.\n\nPrussian service\n\nIn mid-October 1850, a separate treaty between France and Denmark stipulated that the ship would remain German property. In November 1850, it was transferred to the North Sea under the Prussian flag and on November 30, 1850, off Heligoland, it was taken into the fleet of the German Confederation under the command of First Lieutenant Reichardt and recommissioned. Officers Thaulow and Neynaber were court-martialed for insubordination, but were acquitted.\n\nIn 1852, after the dissolution of the Reichsflotte, the ship was bought by Prussia together with the wheeled frigate and put into service under its old name of Gefion. From 1870, she was berthed in Kiel as a accommodation ship. She was struck from the navy list on 5 April 1880, and decommissioned on 5 May that year. The hull was used as a coal hulk and was scrapped at the Kaiserliche Werft in Kiel in the summer of 1891. The figurehead of the Gefion is now in Eckernf\u00f6rde's town hall; a replica serves in the Kurpark as the fountain figure of the Gefion fountain, where the original figurehead was located until about 1980. The ship's anchor can also be seen in the Kurpark.",

  "SimCopter\n\nSimCopter is a 1996 flight simulator video game developed by Maxis. It puts the player into a 3D city. Like Streets of SimCity, SimCopter lets the user import SimCity 2000 maps into the game. It is also the first game to use the Sim language Simlish.\n\nGameplay\n\nSimCopter puts the player in the role of a helicopter pilot. There are two modes of play: user mode and career mode. The user mode (free mode) lets the player fly around cities that they have created (which can be imported from SimCity 2000) or any of the 30 cities supplied with the game. However, user cities sometimes need to be designed with SimCopter in mind; most of the time, the player must increase the number of police stations, fire stations, and hospitals to allow for speedier dispatches. The career mode puts the player in the shoes of a pilot doing various jobs around a city.\n\nWhile all other criminals roam the streets by foot, burglars drive through the city at high speed and are difficult to catch. All types of criminals can be arrested by picking up a police officer from the roof of a police station, and then dropping them near the criminal. Police cars can also be dispatched to aid in the arrest of a criminal. Criminals on foot can also be stopped by landing on top of them with the helicopter, which kills them, but also risks damage to the helicopter. Dropped police officers will call out whether or not they see the suspect; the officers need to be guided by the helicopter's spotlight. If a police officer does not find a suspect, it will return to the helicopter. As soon as a police officer sees a suspect, they will remain in pursuit until the suspect is arrested. Criminals can be slowed down by either using the spotlight or calling out the \"Stop Criminal\" message through the megaphone. Eight jobs are available, namely traffic jams, fires, rescues (which may occur during fire missions), catching criminals, riot control, MEDEVAC, transporting Sims, and speeding cars. Speeders can only be found by looking for a car that is belching exhaust behind it and squeals its tires when making turns. Once a speeder is pulled over, the helicopter must stay with it until a police car arrives to cite them for their reckless driving, or the speeder will take off again.\n\nMoney and points\n\nMoney and points can be earned by completing missions. Money and points can also be lost if the player runs out of time or does not complete a mission. Missions will take points from the player after a set amount of time from the start of the mission while it remains uncompleted. Some missions will eventually be canceled, resulting in a point loss or a forfeited reward after completion. MEDEVAC or firefighting missions will result in large penalties if the victim dies or if the area gets destroyed by the fire. When the player has accumulated enough points, the game lets them move on to the next city. The player then has a choice of going into a new city of the same difficulty or advancing to the next level. There are twelve levels of difficulty, with new types of jobs being introduced and previous types of jobs increasing in difficulty. Jobs will be randomly spawned around the city, but the player's actions can also create jobs.\n\nHelicopters and upgrades\n\nThe player starts with a small, weak helicopter that comes with just a megaphone and a bambi bucket; it can only hold two passengers. As the player accumulates money in the game, they can purchase better helicopters and newer equipment. Some jobs require certain equipment in order to complete them, and better helicopters offer greater speed, smoother handling, and greater passenger capacity. Helicopters have a limited fuel capacity and must return to the hangar about once every half hour to refuel, which costs money. If the helicopter runs out of fuel in mid-air, the player can either attempt to keep the motor spinning and land it, or just let it fall to the ground and suffer heavy damage. If the helicopter remains intact after falling to the ground, it can be refueled at a highly inflated price.\n\nCrashing the helicopter into a building or slamming it into the ground will not destroy it instantly, but will damage it. The more damage there is to the helicopter, the harder it is to control. Money can be spent to repair a helicopter. If the helicopter is destroyed, it is lost forever along with all of the equipment on board. When a helicopter is destroyed, it may set fire to a nearby building or terrain. If the player does not have enough money to buy a new helicopter, the player is grounded, making it impossible to continue on.\n\nThe helicopters in SimCopter are:\n\nUFOs\n\nMaps that have an Apache in them will also occasionally have a UFO that flies around. They abduct Sims with a mysterious force (Sims will \"dance\" while they ascend), and also randomly shoot vertical beams that start fires if they hit trees or buildings. If the beam hits the player, the screen fades to white and the copter is instantly destroyed. If the UFO falls into the water, the player can rescue a surviving abductee for more points. If the UFO is shot down, the player receives 1,000 points.\n\nControversy\n\nThe game gained controversy when it was discovered that designer Jacques Servin inserted an Easter egg that generated shirtless men in Speedo trunks who hugged and kissed each other and appear in great numbers on certain dates, such as Friday the 13th. The egg was caught shortly after release and removed from future copies of the game. He cited his actions as a response to the intolerable working conditions he allegedly suffered at Maxis, particularly working 60-hour weeks and being denied time off. He also reported that he added the \"studs\", as he called them, after a heterosexual programmer programmed \"bimbo\" female characters into the game, and that he wanted to highlight the \"implicit heterosexuality\" of many games. Although he had initially planned for the characters to appear only occasionally, the random number generator he had created malfunctioned, leading them to appear frequently. Servin was fired as a result, with Maxis reporting that his dismissal was due only to his addition of unauthorized content. This caused a member of AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP), a gay AIDS organization, to call for a boycott of all of Maxis' products, a measure which Servin rejected. Some months later, a group named RTMark announced its existence and claimed responsibility for the Easter egg being inserted into the game, along with 16 other acts of \"creative subversion.\" Servin stated that he had received a money order of $5,000 from RTMark for the prank. It was revealed later on that Servin was a cofounder of RTMark.",

  "Northern vigor\n\nNorthern vigor is an effect seen in certain varieties of produce where varieties of plants grown in northern climates, then moved to southern climates, are hardier, better-producing, and better tasting. This effect has been primarily observed in potatoes, but is also seen in strawberries and garlic. The Saskatchewan Seed Potato Growers Association has trademarked the term \"Northern Vigour\" for use with their potatoes, but the effect is seen in produce grown throughout Canada and the northern United States.\n\nThe exact cause of northern vigor is not known, but there are many theories. Some believe it has to do with the length of the days in northern latitudes, or that it has to do with the combination of cold nights and hot days. Others believe that the cold may kill off any disease that would otherwise affect plants from the south. Still others think that the switch from a colder climate to a warm, less harsh environment makes it easier for the plants to thrive. Researchers in Saskatchewan discovered that tubers raised in the cold and then moved to a warm environment undergo a series of physiological changes that may trigger more vigorous growth.",

The station is close to North Ealing tube station on the Piccadilly line, 550 metres away at the western end of Queens Drive.\n\nHistory\n\nAs Transport for London explains: On 18 August 1911, the Central London Railway abandoned its policy of no through running with any other railway, and secured powers to build a short extension from Wood Lane to connect with the intended Ealing & Shepherds Bush line of the Great Western Railway, over which it proposed to exercise running powers.\n\nThe Great Western Railway (GWR) built the Ealing Broadway branch (the western part of the former Ealing & Shepherd's Bush Railway) and opened it for freight trains in April 1917, and the Central London Railway trains used the line from 3 August 1920. West Acton and were built and owned by the GWR, and both opened on 5 November 1923.\n\nGWR steam freight trains also ran through West Acton until 1938, when the London Underground tracks were segregated further east, through East Acton station, and to the west of North Acton station.\n\nThe current station, replacing the original building, was designed by the Great Western Railway, on behalf of London Transport, as part of the LPTB's 1935-40 New Works Programme improvements and extensions to the Central line.

  "John H. Addams\n\nJohn Huy Addams (July 12, 1822 \u2013 August 17, 1881) was a politician and businessman from the U.S. state of Illinois. Addams was born in Pennsylvania in 1822, where he married Sarah Weber (1817\u20131863). In 1844 the couple moved to Cedarville, Illinois and he purchased the Cedar Creek Mill. Addams quickly became a successful businessman working as a director for two railroad companies and a bank president. He constructed a prominent Federal style home in 1854 which still stands today. He and his wife Sarah (Weber) Addams had nine children, including Alice Haldeman and social activist Jane Addams.\n\nAddams became active in state politics and eventually served as an eight-term Illinois State Senator, from 1854 to 1870. In 1863, his wife, Sarah, died and he was remarried in 1868 to Anna Haldeman, herself a widow. He was a key influence on his daughter Jane and part of the reason she focused so much attention on social causes. He died in Green Bay, Wisconsin while on a family vacation in 1881.\n\nEarly life\n\nJohn Huy Addams was born in Sinking Spring, Pennsylvania in on July 12, 1822. He married Sarah Weber, five years his elder, while still living in Kreidersville, Pennsylvania. Both families, Addams and Weber, were from old Pennsylvanian lineage; Addams' ancestors had been granted land by William Penn in the 17th century. In 1844 Addams, then 22, and his new bride arrived in Cedarville, Illinois, near the Illinois-Wisconsin state border in Stephenson County. Addams established himself quickly as a successful mill operator when he purchased the Cedar Creek Mill in 1844. When the couple first arrived in Stephenson County they lived in a small two-room home with a loft. In 1854 Addams completed construction on an addition which made the Addams' home a much larger, prominent Federal style house. Though the couple had nine children, only four survived to adulthood; their eighth child was Nobel Peace Prize recipient Jane Addams, born at the Addams House in Cedarville on September 6, 1860.\n\nIn January 1863 Sarah Addams, then pregnant with her ninth child, went to assist in the delivery of a baby for the wagon-maker's wife. During the birth, she collapsed and was carried home. Sarah's own baby was delivered prematurely and as a result, stillborn. Sarah died a week later; Jane was just 2 years and 4 months old at the time of her mother's death. Jane Addams was cared for mostly by her older sisters after 1863.\n\nBusiness career\n\nAddams' milling business became one of the largest operations in northern Illinois, comprising a saw mill, linseed mill, and grist mill along Cedar Creek on the Addams' property. The mill also represented the start of Addams' successful business career. From 1864 until 1881 he was the president of the Second National Bank in Freeport, Illinois. Addams also served in directorships with the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad and the Illinois Central Railroad, he was also a founder of the Mutual Fire Insurance Company in 1867. Addams achieved a level of local fame due to his many successful business ventures and was regarded as Stephenson County's most successful entrepreneur.\n\nPolitical career and the Civil War\n\nAddams served for sixteen years in the Illinois Senate, where he acquired a reputation for integrity; as one historian phrased it, \"he became famous as a man who not only had never taken a bribe, but had never been offered one. He participated in the founding of the Republican Party and was a friend of Abraham Lincoln's.\n\nDuring the Civil War, Addams helped to raise and equip a regiment that became known as \"the Addams Guard.\"\n\nInfluence on Jane Addams\n\nJane Addams stated that her father, John, was a primary influence in her life. In her 1910 autobiography she described various ways in which she attempted to imitate her father, as well as establishing him as her primary influencer. She stated that her father was her reason for civic involvement and interest in the \"moral concerns of life.\" It was Addams' deep civic involvement that had such a profound influence on his daughter, Jane. John Addams was active in the Cedarville School Board and a trustee of the Rockford Young Ladies' Seminary, later known as Rockford College, where Jane would earn her undergraduate degree. Besides his role in founding the state's Republican Party he was also one of the key individuals who helped bring the second Lincoln-Douglas Debate to Freeport.\n\nLate life and death\n\nIn 1867, four years after Sarah Addams' death, John H. Addams was remarried to Anna H. Haldeman. Haldeman was herself a widow who brought two additional children of her own into the family. One of her sons, George, would also have a strong influence on Jane Addams.\n\nIn early August 1881, Addams decided to take his family on a vacation in northwestern Michigan, where he planned to inspect some of the iron and copper ore mines as potential investments; they left on August 4. A week later John Addams became ill while climbing in an ore mine and the family decided to return home by train. They made it to Green Bay, Wisconsin before Addams was too sick to travel any further and the family booked a hotel room. John H. Addams died suddenly of acute appendicitis on August 17, 1881 in the hotel in Green Bay at the age of 59. His death came as a shock to his daughter Jane, and she spent eight years in a state of (or in depression) depression after his death.",

The game is notable for featuring nearly every monster in the Godzilla franchise up until the time of its release.\n\nStory\n\nWhile the game does not feature a distinguishable story, the basic premise is that hundreds of monsters have arisen all over Japan and Godzilla is the only one who can defeat all of them. Human armies will attempt to slow down Godzilla and the other monsters' rampage. The game ends with a final battle between Godzilla and Super MechaGodzilla, with Godzilla emerging as the victor and retaining his title as the King of the Monsters.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe game is a 2D side-scroller, with Godzilla being the only playable character. Godzilla can use a wide variety of attacks, including a punch, a kick, and a tail whip. He can also use his signature atomic breath, which can be fired up, down, or straight. Using the aforementioned attack drains him of his health. If Godzilla stops moving, his health gradually gets restored. Buildings on the background can sometimes be interacted with, and if destroyed, will sometimes refill Godzilla's health quickly.\n\nThe game does not feature a save system, and it only allows the player to continue for three times if they are killed. There are five levels, with each level containing a final boss monster that Godzilla needs to defeat before he is able to progress further into the game.\n\nAside from monsters, various human vehicles such as warships, gunships, fighter jets, and tanks also serve as enemies in the game. However, they do not deal significant damage to Godzilla and can be destroyed easily.\n\nBosses\n\nBelow is a list of the boss monsters in the game, in the order by which they appear.\n\nLevel 1: Osaka\n\nLevel 2: Lake Ashino\n\nLevel 3 : Mt.

  "BC Express (sternwheeler)\n\nThe BC Express was a stern wheel paddle steamer (sternwheeler) that operated on the Fraser River in British Columbia, Canada, from 1912 to 1919. The BC Express was built for the BC Express Company by Alexander Watson, Jr to work on the upper Fraser River between T\u00eate Jaune Cache and Fort George during the busy years of Grand Trunk Pacific Railway construction. The BC Express Company hired Captain Joseph Bucey, an experienced Skeena River pilot, to be her master.\n\nThe route\n\nThe upper Fraser River was navigable by sternwheeler between Soda Creek (start of navigation) and T\u00eate Jaune Cache (head of navigation). From Soda Creek to Fort George there were two formidable obstacles, the Cottonwood Canyon and the Fort George Canyon. Between Fort George and T\u00eate Jaune Cache, there were the Giscome Rapids, the Goat River Rapids and the fearsome Grand Canyon of the Fraser, which contained a powerful whirlpool. The Grand Trunk Pacific was being built from Winnipeg west and from Prince Rupert east. The two lines would meet on April 7, 1914, at Fort Fraser. Each end of construction was a portable town, which consisted of worker's accommodations, stores and even restaurants. These towns were referred to as the \"end of steel\". In 1912, the eastern end of construction would cross the Alberta BC border and by the spring of 1913 it would arrive at T\u00eate Jaune Cache.\n\nConstruction\n\nThe BC Express was the second sternwheeler built by the BC Express Company, the first one being the BX. Like the BX, the BC Express was also built at Soda Creek. And also like the BX, the BC Express's captain was involved in every stage of her planning and construction.\n\nConstruction began on the BC Express in March 1912 at Soda Creek, on the very site where the BX had been built. Although the BC Express, when completed, would look much like her sister ship (lacking only the covered paddlewheel), in actuality the two sternwheelers were very different. They were designed for different purposes on different section of the upper Fraser. Whereas the BX was designed to carry loads upstream from Soda Creek, the BC Express was designed to carry loads downstream from T\u00eate Jaune Cache, which meant she would have to regularly navigate through the perilous Grand Canyon. With these facts in mind Alexander Watson and Joseph Bucey decided to build the BC Express six feet shorter and a foot narrower than the BX. Bucey also had Watson install a special \"monkey rudder\" on the BC Express's fantail, which would help him in maneuvering through the Grand Canyon.\n\n1912\n\nThe BC Express was launched on the 24th of June and Captain Bucey took her up to Fort George on the 29th. He was so impressed by how well she handled in the Cottonwood and Fort George canyons that he took her up to the Grand Canyon the following week, where she had no trouble at all steaming over its infamous and deadly whirlpool. She continued to make trips between the Grand Canyon and Fort George until that September when the water levels dropped so low that Bucey decided that the Giscome Rapids were too unsafe to navigate. In October the water levels rose again and she made several trips between Fort George and Soda Creek before the season ended.\n\n1913\n\n1913 was the busiest year of navigation on the upper Fraser River because the end of steel for the eastern end of construction of the Grand Trunk Pacific had finally reached the head of navigation at T\u00eate Jaune Cache. It was estimated that 3,500 workers were working on the grade between T\u00eate Jaune Cache and Fort George and even more settlers and businessmen were moving into Fort George and the surrounding area. This had created a great surge of traffic over the Cariboo Road and the BC Express Company's stages and automobiles ran day and night to keep up with demand. Captain Bucey was not unaware of how busy and profitable the season would be. In anticipation of extending the BC Express's route all the way to T\u00eate Jaune Cache, he rode the CPR to Edmonton, Alberta and then took the GTP to T\u00eate Jaune Cache. From there he canoed downstream with a companion to Fort George, learning all he could about the upper reaches of the new route.\n\nCaptain Bucey took the BC Express to T\u00eate Jaune Cache that May and returned with just twenty passengers and a small load of cargo. He wanted to see how the sternwheeler would run the Grand Canyon before he took her through with a capacity load. The trip was successful and the BC Express gained the title of the first loaded sternwheeler to ever run the Grand Canyon. Seeing this success, the railway's sternwheelers, the Operator and the Conveyor followed the very next day.\n\nThe BC Express began a weekly round trip service from Fort Gorge to T\u00eate Jaune Cache, carrying capacity loads of freight and passengers. The passenger fare was $35, meals and berths extra, and the freight rate was $80 a ton. This latter seemed quite costly, until the shipper investigated the alternative shipping method, which was shipping his cargo by scow for $70 a ton, with no guarantee that the shipment would arrive intact, or at all. The risk to scows was mostly at the Grand Canyon, and the deadly whirlpool within it, which was responsible for the loss of at least eighty lives that summer alone, as well as the loss of approximately one in ten scows, and thousands of dollars of merchandise. Needless to say, the BC Express did a brisk business that season, often grossing $12,000 on a single trip. She was the only sternwheeler to offer freight and passenger service to the general public, as the Operator and Conveyor were strictly used for hauling their own workers and supplies needed for rail construction. The BC Express also had a very interesting season in 1913 and many stories of what occurred that summer were told and retold for years afterwards.\n\nThe railworkers who wouldn't pay\n\nOne afternoon in June, Bucey was returning from T\u00eate Jaune Cache and had just passed the Grand Canyon when he spotted a white flag on the river bank. This was a sign that someone needed the sternwheeler to stop, either to take on cargo or passengers. The passengers turned out to be twenty burly railworkers with their paychecks in their pockets, all of whom were on their way to Fort George. In particular, South Fort George, where there was a licensed hotel, and a variety of other entertainments, where one could celebrate the end of another work week. However, when the purser approached the first of these men for his fare, the man obstinately refused to pay, even after the purser offered to cash his company paycheck. Fearing that if he let one get away without paying that none would pay, the purser went up to the pilot house and spoke to Captain Bucey. Bucey landed the BC Express again and went down to speak to the man himself. When the man unwisely repeated that he wasn't paying, Bucey called over two deckhands who, without ceremony, threw the man overboard into the river. Bucey calmly returned to the pilot house and steamed the BC Express back into the center of the river again. The ousted passenger, luckily a strong swimmer, had made it to shore, but his companions must not have fancied the idea of following him into the frigid and swift water, as they all paid their fares immediately.\n\nThe poker game\n\nLater that summer, a well known gambler from the Skeena River was aboard, and he spoke to Captain Bucey about the possibility of having a poker game on one of the lower decks. The gambler promised it would not only occupy the players, but some spectators as well. Bucey was agreeable to the idea and gave his consent. Although gambling on sternwheelers that held liquor licenses was illegal, it was also a long and much-loved tradition. The game started off modestly enough, but soon huge sums were being wagered, and some large jackpots were being won. Present since the start of the game was a stranger, who was a provincial policeman who was being transferred to a new post by the constable at Fort George. Several hours into play, and when the table was covered with a drift of bills, this man abruptly announced his identity, declared the game illegal and confiscated all the money. The players and other spectators were outraged and immediately turned into an angry mob. The Skeena River gambler jumped to the policeman's defense and let the man return to his stateroom while he tried to mollify the angry men. After promising to refund any losses, the gambler went to speak to Captain Bucey to see what could be done about the matter. Bucey thought for a moment and then suggested to the gambler that he go talk to the policeman and suggest that if he let the game continue, he can keep half the money he took. The gambler did so, and was surprised when the policeman accepted the bribe. Upon hearing of the policeman's decision, Bucey had his first mate take over at the wheel, and accompanied by two deckhands, he went to the policeman's stateroom and took him down to the lower deck where the game had started again. Once there he told everyone how the policeman had tried to steal their money, but he assured everyone that he had complete control of his own ship, and that this incident would be reported to the magistrate at Fort George, and that the crooked policeman would be on the next steamer south. The bribe was surrendered, and the game continued unhampered. Captain Bucey had won the respect of his",

  "Geffrey Davis\n\nGeffrey Davis (born 1983) is an American poet and professor. He is the author of Revising the Storm (2014) and Night Angler (2019). He teaches in The Arkansas Programs in Creative Writing and Translation at the University of Arkansas and lives in Fayetteville, Arkansas. He also serves on the poetry faculty at the Rainier Writing Workshop, a low-residency MFA program at Pacific Lutheran University.\n\nPersonal life and education\n\nDavis was born in Seattle, Washington in 1983 and grew up in Tacoma, Washington. He has two younger brothers and a younger sister. At the time of Davis' birth, his father was in the Navy, although a serious ankle injury led to his medical discharge. He became a blue-collar worker after that: roofing, welding, building custom campers, etc. Davis' father developed a drug addiction when Davis was a toddler, causing the family to move around frequently while he was growing up. The family lived in 10 different cities and about 14 different houses, including a trailer park and a little time spent in a family shelter. One memorable place they lived (when Davis was about 7 or 8 years old) was a large farm in a small, rural town called Onalaska, WA. The farm had all kinds of livestock and wide fields of hay. Davis left that farm with a deeper love of the outdoors and especially of fishing. When he was partway through the 4th grade, the family moved to Tacoma, WA, where they more-or-less put down roots. Many of these places appear throughout Davis' poetry, especially his first book Revising the Storm (2014). His mother worked primarily in education and childcare, often relying on side jobs to make ends meet, until the housing crisis in 2008 forced her to work full-time for a major department store retailer.\n\nDavis attended Stadium High School, a public school in Tacoma. Davis graduated from Stadium High School in 2001 and started writing poetry seriously that summer, after a best friend who was a writer invited him to try writing a poem.\n\nDavis earned his B.A. from Oregon State University in 2006, made possible through a combination of scholarships and federal aid. Throughout college, he also worked several different jobs\u2014washing dishes, plumbing, painting houses, tutoring\u2014to help pay his way. These experiences are later referenced in his poetry. As an undergraduate student, Davis first double majored in zoology and photography, intending to become a wildlife journalist and study wolves. However, he started struggling with many of the required courses for the science degree and nearly failed out of college. He was encouraged by mentors to switch his major to English, given his tendency to take literature courses as electives. He fell in love instantly with his new major and his grades and academic experience improved immediately. As an English major at Oregon State, he took creative writing courses from the poets Joseph Millar and David Biespiel and from the fiction writer Marjorie Sandor.\n\nAfter taking a year off after graduation, Davis worked at a grocery store until he moved to State College, Pennsylvania, where Davis received three graduate degrees\u2014an M.A. in English (2009), an M.F.A. in Poetry (2012), and a Ph.D. in English (2014)\u2014from The Pennsylvania State University.\n\nAs a graduate student, Davis was enrolled in the MA/PhD track, which focused on studying and writing critically about literature. However, he kept sneaking into the occasional creative writing workshop. After completing the Master of Arts (MFA) degree in English in 2009, the poet Robin Becker, who was a professor of creative writing at Penn State at the time, invited Davis to join the creative writing program in poetry. He became dually enrolled in both the PhD program and the MFA program. He completed the MFA degree in 2012, under the mentorship of poets Robin Becker and Julia Spicher Kasdorf. His first book, Revising the Storm, began as his MFA thesis and was revised heavily over the next two years.\n\nAs a graduate student at Penn State, Davis met his now-wife, scholar and writer Lissette Lopez Szwydky, and they have a son. While a graduate student at Penn State, Davis joined Cave Canem, which he regularly praises as having heavily influenced his development as a writer and a teacher. He was a fellow of Cave Canem in 2012 and 2013.\n\nAwards and honors\n\nRevising the Storm won the 2013 A. Poulin, Jr. Poetry Prize, selected by Dorianne Laux, and was named a finalist for the 2015 Hurston-Wright Legacy Award. Davis has received the Anne Halley Poetry Prize, the Dogwood Prize in Poetry, the Leonard Steinberg Memorial/Academy of American Poets Prize, the Wabash Prize for Poetry, and fellowships from the Cave Canem Foundation. His poems have been published in numerous literary journals and magazines, including Crazyhorse, Hayden\u2019s Ferry Review, The Massachusetts Review, Mid-American Review, Mississippi Review, The New York Times Magazine, Nimrod International Journal, and Sycamore Review. In 2011, Davis co-founded the journal Toe Good Poetry with Jerry Brunoe and Kevin Hockett. In 2018, he received a fellowship from the prestigious Bread Loaf Writers' Conference.\n\nHis second book of poetry, Night Angler (BOA Editions, 2019) won the 2018 James Laughlin Award, a second-book prize from the Academy of American Poets.",
  "Delphian Society\n\nThe Delphian Society was a national organization that promoted the education of women in the United States. This organization was founded around 1910 in Chicago.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Delphian Society takes its name from the historical Oracle of Delphi of Phocis, Greece. \"Here in remote times Apollo was believed to reveal his wishes to men through the medium of a priestess, speaking under the influence of vaporous breath which rose from a yawning fissure. Her utterances were not always coherent and were interpreted to those seeking guidance by Apollo's priests.\"\n\nIn 1913, the Delphian Society wrote, \"We know full well today that no priestess upon a tripod can reveal to us the secrets of the future. A thorough understanding of the past must be the safest guide for coming years. No vapor can inspire sudden revelations--the result only of faithful effort and earnest thought. Yet the story of the ancient oracle charms us still and when a name was sought for a national organization, that had for its avowed purposed the promotion of educational interests in a continent, none was deemed more suitable than that which for so many years cast its gracious spell from one sea to another.\"\n\nThe Delphian Society was inspired by influential Harvard President, Charles William Eliot's belief that education serves the purpose of inspiring lifelong learning and those who do not receive it \"seem to live in a mental vacuum.\" However, \"Fifteen minutes a day of good reading would have given any one of this multitude a really human life.\" In response to his call for lifelong learning, the Delphian Society wrote, \"To meet this condition, which prevails through the length and breadth of our land, to stimulate a deeper interest, quicken a latent appreciation and facilitate the use of brief periods of freedom for self-improvement, the Delphian Society was organized and the Delphian Course of Reading made possible.\"\n\nIn 1913, the Delphian Society published the Delphian Course of Reading: \"A systematic plan of education, embracing the world's progress and development of the liberal arts.\" This ten volume course covers \"history, literature, philosophy, poetry, fiction, drama, art, ethics, music,\" however, \"Mathematics, being in its higher forms essential to few, has been omitted; languages, requiring the aid of a teacher, and such sciences as make laboratories necessary, are not included.\". It also published The World's Progress\n\nIn 1928, the Delphian Society published several volumes of books containing an outline of human knowledge for the use of conversation.\n\nMore educational volumes were published by the society in the following decades, such as The Delphian Text, The Delphian Course, Orientation for Modern Times, and Patterns for Modern Living.\n\nThere are continuing chapters of the society, such as the Houston Assembly of Delphian Chapters.",

  "Fiona Coote\n\nFiona Coote was Australia's youngest heart transplant recipient when she underwent surgery at the age of 14 on 8 April 1984. While Coote was the fourth transplant recipient in Australia, she is only the second to survive for a significant period.\n\nPersonal life\n\nBorn on 3 January 1970 and growing up on a family farm, Galen, 8 km from Manilla in northern New South Wales, Coote attended a private Catholic school near Tamworth. She married in 1996.\n\nHeart transplant\n\nThe procedure was performed by the Chinese\u2013Australian cardiothoracic surgeon Dr Victor Chang. The urgency was due to complications of viral-induced tonsilitis that dramatically weakened her heart. The surgery was performed at St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney. When she later began rejecting the first heart, Coote was forced to endure a second transplant, which took place in 1986. She has enjoyed good health since.\n\nPost transplant\n\nMuch of Coote's life has been spent in the public eye and she has worked for numerous charitable organisations including the Victor Chang Foundation and the Starlight Foundation. In 1999, Coote was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in recognition of her public awareness promotion of heart disease, and for her work raising funds for seriously and terminally ill children. Coote has also worked in promotions for Willow Valley, a cereal manufacturer, and Dairy Farmers.\n\nAs a result of her fame, Coote was approached to appear in the Australian soap Neighbours. Despite beginning rehearsals, Coote ultimately decided acting was not for her. Channel Ten publicly blamed the back down on illness but Coote later attributed it to the associated pressure to participate in interviews and publicity for the show. Coote has made a number of television appearances, including appearing in a segment on Burke's Backyard.\n\nIn 2001 a rose was named in honour of Coote. Called \"Fiona's Wish\", it is a hybrid tea (bush rose) and the bi-coloured blooms are cherry red, edged with gold reverse.",
  "Dynamic dispatch\n\nIn computer science, dynamic dispatch is the process of selecting which implementation of a polymorphic operation (method or function) to call at run time. It is commonly employed in, and considered a prime characteristic of, object-oriented programming (OOP) languages and systems.\n\nObject-oriented systems model a problem as a set of interacting objects that enact operations referred to by name. Polymorphism is the phenomenon wherein somewhat interchangeable objects each expose an operation of the same name but possibly differing in behavior. As an example, a File object and a Database object both have a StoreRecord method that can be used to write a personnel record to storage. Their implementations differ. A program holds a reference to an object which may be either a File object or a Database object. Which it is may have been determined by a run-time setting, and at this stage, the program may not know or care which. When the program calls StoreRecord on the object, something needs to choose which behavior gets enacted. If one thinks of OOP as sending messages to objects, then in this example the program sends a StoreRecord message to an object of unknown type, leaving it to the run-time support system to dispatch the message to the right object. The object enacts whichever behavior it implements.\n\nDynamic dispatch contrasts with static dispatch, in which the implementation of a polymorphic operation is selected at compile time. The purpose of dynamic dispatch is to defer the selection of an appropriate implementation until the run time type of a parameter (or multiple parameters) is known.\n\nDynamic dispatch is different from late binding (also known as dynamic binding). Name binding associates a name with an operation. A polymorphic operation has several implementations, all associated with the same name. Bindings can be made at compile time or (with late binding) at run time. With dynamic dispatch, one particular implementation of an operation is chosen at run time. While dynamic dispatch does not imply late binding, late binding does imply dynamic dispatch, since the implementation of a late-bound operation is not known until run time.\n\nSingle and multiple dispatch\n\nThe choice of which version of a method to call may be based either on a single object, or on a combination of objects. The former is called single dispatch and is directly supported by common object-oriented languages such as Smalltalk, C++, Java, C#, Objective-C, Swift, JavaScript, and Python. In these and similar languages, one may call a method for division with syntax that resembles where the parameters are optional. This is thought of as sending a message named divide with parameter divisor to dividend. An implementation will be chosen based only on dividend's type (perhaps rational, floating point, matrix), disregarding the type or value of divisor.\n\nBy contrast, some languages dispatch methods or functions based on the combination of operands; in the division case, the types of the dividend and divisor together determine which divide operation will be performed. This is known as multiple dispatch. Examples of languages that support multiple dispatch are Common Lisp, Dylan, and Julia.\n\nDynamic dispatch mechanisms\n\nA language may be implemented with different dynamic dispatch mechanisms. The choices of the dynamic dispatch mechanism offered by a language to a large extent alter the programming paradigms that are available or are most natural to use within a given language.\n\nNormally, in a typed language, the dispatch mechanism will be performed based on the type of the arguments (most commonly based on the type of the receiver of a message). Languages with weak or no typing systems often carry a dispatch table as part of the object data for each object. This allows instance behaviour as each instance may map a given message to a separate method.\n\nSome languages offer a hybrid approach.\n\nDynamic dispatch will always incur an overhead so some languages offer static dispatch for particular methods.\n\nC++ implementation\n\nC++ uses early binding and offers both dynamic and static dispatch. The default form of dispatch is static. To get dynamic dispatch the programmer must declare a method as virtual.\n\nC++ compilers typically implement dynamic dispatch with a data structure called a virtual function table (vtable) that defines the name-to-implementation mapping for a given class as a set of member function pointers. (This is purely an implementation detail; the C++ specification does not mention vtables.) Instances of that type will then store a pointer to this table as part of their instance data. This is complicated when multiple inheritance is used. Since C++ does not support late binding, the virtual table in a C++ object cannot be modified at run-time, which limits the potential set of dispatch targets to a finite set chosen at compile time.\n\nType overloading does not produce dynamic dispatch in C++ as the language considers the types of the message parameters part of the formal message name. This means that the message name the programmer sees is not the formal name used for binding.\n\nGo and Rust implementation\n\nIn Go, Rust and Nim, a more versatile variation of early binding is used. Vtable pointers are carried with object references as 'fat pointers' ('interfaces' in Go, or 'trait objects' in Rust).\n\nThis decouples the supported interfaces from the underlying data structures. Each compiled library needn't know the full range of interfaces supported in order to correctly use a type, just the specific vtable layout that they require. Code can pass around different interfaces to the same piece of data to different functions. This versatility comes at the expense of extra data with each object reference, which is problematic if many such references are stored persistently.\n\nThe term fat pointer simply refers to a pointer with additional associated information. The additional information may be a vtable pointer for dynamic dispatch described above, but is more commonly the associated object's size to describe e.g. a slice.\n\nSmalltalk implementation\n\nSmalltalk uses a type-based message dispatcher. Each instance has a single type whose definition contains the methods. When an instance receives a message, the dispatcher looks up the corresponding method in the message-to-method map for the type and then invokes the method.\n\nBecause a type can have a chain of base types, this look-up can be expensive. A naive implementation of Smalltalk's mechanism would seem to have a significantly higher overhead than that of C++ and this overhead would be incurred for each and every message that an object receives.\n\nReal Smalltalk implementations often use a technique known as inline caching that makes method dispatch very fast. Inline caching basically stores the previous destination method address and object class of the call site (or multiple pairs for multi-way caching). The cached method is initialized with the most common target method (or just the cache miss handler), based on the method selector. When the method call site is reached during execution, it just calls the address in the cache. (In a dynamic code generator, this call is a direct call as the direct address is back patched by cache miss logic.) Prologue code in the called method then compares the cached class with the actual object class, and if they don't match, execution branches to a cache miss handler to find the correct method in the class. A fast implementation may have multiple cache entries and it often only takes a couple of instructions to get execution to the correct method on an initial cache miss. The common case will be a cached class match, and execution will just continue in the method.\n\nOut-of-line caching can also be used in the method invocation logic, using the object class and method selector. In one design, the class and method selector are hashed, and used as an index into a method dispatch cache table.\n\nAs Smalltalk is a reflective language, many implementations allow mutating individual objects into objects with dynamically generated method lookup tables. This allows altering object behavior on a per object basis. A whole category of languages known as prototype-based languages has grown from this, the most famous of which are Self and JavaScript. Careful design of the method dispatch caching allows even prototype-based languages to have high-performance method dispatch.\n\nMany other dynamically typed languages, including Python, Ruby, Objective-C and Groovy use similar approaches.",

  "V. Anandasangaree\n\nVeerasingham Anandasangaree (\u0bb5\u0bc0\u0bb0\u0b9a\u0bbf\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bae\u0bcd \u0b86\u0ba9\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0b9a\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bb0\u0bbf) is a leading Sri Lankan Tamil politician, former Member of Parliament and leader of the Tamil United Liberation Front. He is commonly known as Sangaree. A vocal critic of violence committed by all sides, Sangaree is a supporter of federalism similar to that of India as a solution to Sri Lanka's ethnic conflict.\n\nEarly life\n\nSangaree was born 15 June 1933 in Point Pedro in northern province of Ceylon. He was the son of Sangarapillai Veerasingham, the principal of Sri Somaskanda College Puttur, and Ratnamma from Thumpalai near Point Pedro. He grew up in Achchuveli. He had six brothers and two sisters. He was educated at Sri Somaskanda College Puttur, Christian College Atchuvely Achchuveli, Hartley College and Zahira College, Colombo. Between 1953 and 1959 he taught at Jaffna Hindu College, Poonakari M.M.V., Christ the King College Ja-Ela and Sri Kotalawelapura G.T.M.S. Ratmalana. He later studied at Colombo Law College. After graduation in 1967 he joined the legal profession, becoming an attorney at law.\n\nSangaree's elder brother Rajasangaree, chairman of Chavakachcheri Citizens\u2019 Committee, was murdered by the pro-Indian Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front on 26 October 1987 after Rajasangaree complained about abuses being committed by the Indian Peace Keeping Force. Sangaree's younger brother Ganeshasangaree was murdered by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam on 10 February 1988 after Ganeshasangaree criticised the Tigers in public. When two of Ganeshasangaree's sons complained about their father's killing they were taken away by the Tigers and never seen again. G. Yogasangari, the son of Sangaree's brother Ganeshasangaree, was an EPRLF Member of Parliament. Yogasangaree, EPRLF leader K. Pathmanabha and others were assassinated by the Tigers on 19 June 1990 in Kodambakkam, India. Sayanuja, the daughter of Sangaree's brother Parathasangaree, was killed on the Tavistock Square bus bombing on 7 July 2005.\n\nPolitical career\n\nSangaree became interested in politics at an early age and in 1955 joined the Lanka Sama Samaja Party, the leading leftist party in Ceylon at that time. He was the LSSP's candidate for Kotahena South Ward at the 1959 Colombo Municipal Council election against the incumbent mayor V. A. Sugathadasa but failed to get elected. He was persuaded to stand as the LSSP candidate in Kilinochchi at the March 1960 parliamentary election even though he had no connection to the area. He lost. He stood again at the July 1960 and 1965 parliamentary elections but was again defeated on each occasion.\n\nThe leftist parties of Ceylon, who had in the past argued for parity between the Sinhala and Tamil languages, abandoned their beliefs in the late 1960s. They allied themselves with the communal Sri Lanka Freedom Party, who had made Sinhala the sole official language of Ceylon, and opposed the reasonable use of Tamil proposed by the Dudley-Chelvanayakam Pact signed by the United National Party Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake. The leftist parties adopted the racist slogan \"Dudleyge bade masala vadai\" - translation \"there is masala vadai in Dudley's belly\" (masala vadai is a Tamil delicacy). Sangaree, like many other Tamil leftists, became disillusioned with the leftist parties. Sangaree left the LSSP in 1966.\n\nSangaree was chairman of Karaichi Village Council between 1965 and 1968. He joined the All Ceylon Tamil Congress (ACTC) in May 1966. Karaichi Village Council was promoted town council in 1968. Sangaree was elected to Kilinochchi Town Council in 1968 and became its first chairman. Sangaree became the president of the ACTC's Youth Front in 1970. He stood as the ACTC candidate in Kilinochchi at the 1970 parliamentary election. He won the election and entered Parliament.\n\nIn 1972 the ACTC, Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi and others formed the Tamil United Front (later renamed Tamil United Liberation Front). Sangaree was the TULF's candidate for Kilinochchi at the 1977 parliamentary election which he won. Sangaree and all other TULF MPs boycotted Parliament from the middle of 1983 for a number of reasons: they were under pressure from Sri Lankan Tamil militants not to stay in Parliament beyond their normal six-year term; the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka required them to swear an oath unconditionally renouncing support for a separate state; and the Black July riots in which up to 3,000 Tamils were murdered by Sinhalese mobs. After three months of absence, Sangaree forfeited his seat in Parliament on 22 October 1983. His refusal to take the oath under the Sixth Amendment also barred him from practising as a lawyer.\n\nSangaree and his family, like many families of leading Tamil politicians, fled to Madras (now Chennai), Tamil Nadu. After the signing of the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord in 1987 Sangaree returned to Sri Lanka. He was one of the TULF's candidates in Jaffna District at the 1989 parliamentary election but failed to get elected. He was elected senior vice president of the TULF in 1993. He was one of the TULF's candidates in Vanni District at the 1994 parliamentary election but again failed to get elected.\n\nSangaree was a TULF candidate for Jaffna District at the 2000 parliamentary election. He was elected and re-entered Parliament. In 2001 the TULF, ACTC, Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front and Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization formed the Tamil National Alliance (TNA). Sangaree was one of the TNA's candidates in Jaffna District at the 2001 parliamentary election. He was re-elected. Sangaree was elected leader and president of the TULF in June 2002 following the death of M. Sivasithamparam.\n\nSoon after its formation the TNA began to make a more pro-Tamil Tiger stance, recognising the Tigers as the sole representative of the Sri Lankan Tamils. This caused a split within the TULF. Some members of the TULF, led by its president Sangaree, were opposed to the Tigers. A long legal battle ensued for control of the TULF. Sangaree refused to allow the TNA to use the TULF name during the 2004 parliamentary election. This caused the members of TULF who wished to remain with the TNA, led by R. Sampanthan, to resurrect the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi political party. The TNA contested the 2004 parliamentary election under the ITAK symbol. The legal battle over the control of TULF meant that the TULF and Sangaree had to contest the 2004 parliamentary election as an independent group. The group failed to win any seats.\n\nSangaree eventually won full control of the TULF but most of its leading members had already left the party and it had lost most of its political support. Sangaree had been a vocal critic of the government sponsored paramilitary groups. Following the dismal showing of the rump TULF in elections, Sangaree abandoned his beliefs and joined forces with two paramilitary groups (People's Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam and Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front (Padmanaba wing)) to form the Democratic Tamil National Alliance. This new alliance contested provincial and local elections but with little success though Sangaree was elected to Jaffna Municipal Council at the 2009 local elections. Sangaree did another volte-face in 2011, joining force with the TNA to contest the 2011 local elections.\n\nUNESCO award\n\nSangaree was awarded the 2006 UNESCO-Madanjeet Singh Prize for the Promotion of Tolerance and Non-Violence. The UNESCO statement said \"As an indefatigable advocate of democracy and peaceful conflict resolution, he has contributed to raising awareness of the Tamil cause in a spirit of dialogue, while seeking to promote non-violent solutions to Sri Lanka and opposing terrorism\". Sangaree collected his $100,000 prize at a ceremony held at UNESCO headquarters in Paris, France, on 16 November 2006.",

  "Colony (fraternity or sorority)\n\nA colony is a probationary body of a national fraternity or sorority. It can be considered a new Greek organization that is awaiting official recognition from their international headquarters to maintain a chapter on their college\u2019s campus. A group wishing to become a member of a fraternity or sorority must first petition for status as a colony. The entire membership of the colony remains as uninitiated associates, usually learning and operating under the guidance of an advisor from the national organization and/or from a sponsoring chapter.\n\nIf the colony prospers and meets its goals as set out by the national organization, the colony may later be chartered and the membership initiated. After this the sorority or fraternity will become a full chapter of the fraternity. This practice varies with different sororities and fraternities; however, many of them follow procedures and practices very similar to one another. Everything depends on the official nationals of each individual organization.\n\nHistory\n\nThe first Greek society was Phi Beta Kappa and was founded in 1776 as a literary and debating club. The oldest social fraternity is the Kappa Alpha Society, formed at Union College in New York in 1825. This fraternity was soon followed by several others in the following years.\n\nSeveral other Greek organizations were formed through the twentieth century. With each separate sorority and fraternity, others began to charter existing organizations at different schools. This became popular in the 1900s, especially after World War II and the Great Depression.\n\nNomenclature\n\nThe term \"Colony\" is the most commonly accepted word used to describe new local groups being formed. However, some organizations have adopted alternative terminology, responding to sensitivities over the potential politically-charged origin of this word. Synonyms include \"Provisional Chapter\", \"Probationary Chapter\", \"Associate Chapter\", or for the newest of groups, \"Interest Groups\". These terms may be further defined within the legal framework of a specific fraternity, sorority or society to have particular meanings. Regardless of which word is used, a colony is generally probationary in nature and has not yet been granted a charter or warrant enabling it to have legal status as a unit of the national organization.\n\nPractices and procedures\n\nDifferent Greek organizations have different practices and procedures when establishing colonies and maturing them into chapters. Not only does this process depend on the specific Greek organization, but it also depends on the standards and rules that are set by each individual university. However, many organizations have a process that is similar to this:\n\nNational, or when available, local alumni volunteers will work with the colony to establish effective chapter operations, develop scholarship programs, teach recruitment skills and devise a long-term plan of action. For most Greek organizations, there is a good chance that there are at least several alumni near the given school. Most sororities or fraternities get into contact with these alumni through their nationals. Nationals also send what can be referred to as \"Education Consultants,\" who are paid by the organization, to spend time with the colony to teach them all of the traditions, values and ways of the fraternity or sorority. Staff members from the national organizations assist the colony as needed in the process of earning a charter, giving them formal and legal recognition as a chapter.\n\nRole as a colony\n\nAs a colony, most universities allow the members to participate in all Greek activities on campus. These activities include the Interfraternity Council, or IFC; Panhellenic Council, or PHC; student government, new-student orientation; intramural athletics; leadership honoraries and other such activities. These activities can give colony members an opportunity to get established in their university\u2019s Greek community and meet potential new members that later could join their colony or chapter.",
  "Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise de Physique\n\nThe Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise de Physique (SFP), or the French Physical Society, is the main professional society of French physicists. It was founded in 1873 by Charles Joseph d'Almeida.\n\nHistory\n\nThe French Physical Society is a state-approved non-profit scientific society aiming to promote the knowledge of physics. Its member include physicists living in France, regardless of background.\n\nAs well as promoting physics, the SFP also acts as a lobbying organization with French policymakers alongside other scientific societies, the like the French Academy of Sciences, French Society of Mathematicians, and Union of Physicists.\n\nThe SFP organizes a large number of events (conferences, workshops, exhibitions, etc.) for academic and general audiences. The SFP edits the Bulletin Newsletters and the review Reflets de la Physique. Each year, the SFP awards several prizes to physicists in honor of specific works or actions towards the promotion of physics outside the community.\n\nThe SFP is a member of the European Physical Society (EPS) and of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP).\n\nEmergent Scientist\n\nEmergent Scientist is a scientific and educational open access academic journal, which positions itself as a journal that helps students get their first publication experience. It was established in 2016 on the initiative of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\n\nThe main authors are the participants of the International Physicists' Tournament, who are given the opportunity to publish their articles with the solutions of the tournament problems in the journal free of charge (financed by the organizing committee of the tournament). Other articles on physics and mathematics can also be published in the journal, but at the charge of the authors. It is not necessary that articles are innovative, they can even focus on well-known phenomena, but they must study the problems from a scientific and didactic point of view. On the other hand, the journal places high emphasis on the quality of presentation of the results and their scientific substantiation. In a special section of the journal entitled Dead Ends, authors are invited to discuss theoretical approaches and experimental research that failed for one reason or another.",
  "Gardnerville Branch Jail\n\nThe Gardnerville Branch Jail is a historic jail located at 1440 Courthouse St. in Gardnerville, Nevada. The jail was built in 1910 and served as Douglas County's only jail from 1910 to 1915. Prior to 1910, the only county jail was in Genoa, the county seat; however, since Gardnerville was several miles from Genoa, it resorted to housing prisoners in the local judge's granary. As the granary was considered unfit for holding prisoners, the community petitioned the county to construct a new jail. However, local leaders in Minden, who wanted to move the county seat to their town, protested the move, as they suspected that Gardnerville was attempting to claim the county seat itself. Nonetheless, the county approved the construction of the new jail. The jail housed its first prisoners before construction even finished, as the Genoa jail burned down; one prisoner was briefly chained to a post until the new jail could accommodate him. Once completed, the jail served the county until 1915, when Minden became the county seat and opened its own county jail.\n\nOnce it no longer served as the county jail, the Gardnerville jail took on another, racially charged purpose. Gardnerville was a sundown town, and it rang a bell every night to order American Indians out of town. In addition, the unemployed were considered vagrants and were not allowed on the town's streets after dark. The jail housed violators of both of these policies until it closed in the 1950s.\n\nThe jail was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 16, 2003.",

  "USS Kirwin (APD-90)\n\nUSS Kirwin (APD-90), ex-DE-229, later LPR-90, was a United States Navy high-speed transport in commission from 1945 to 1946 and from 1965 to 1969.\n\nNamesake\n\nJohn Joseph Kirwin was born on 4 July 1918 in Newport, Rhode Island. He enlisted in the United States Naval Reserve on 11 December 1935. He was appointed midshipman on 11 August 1937, and commissioned as an ensign on 7 February 1941, reporting for duty aboard light cruiser USS Savannah (CL-42).\n\nDuring World War II, Kirwin was appointed Lieutenant, junior grade, on 16 June 1942, and saw action aboard Savannah in the Battle of the Atlantic and in Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of North Africa. He was promoted to Lieutenant on 1 December 1942, and saw further combat aboard Savannah in Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily. Savannah then supported Operation Avalanche, the Allied invasion of mainland Italy at Salerno. On 11 September 1943, while bombarding German shore defenses in Salerno Bay, Savannah was among cruisers which came under heavy German aerial attack. The cruisers and British fighters drove off nearly 60 German bombers before a Dornier Do 217K-2 bomber hit Savannah with a Fritz X radio-controlled, armor-piercing guided bomb. It pierced the armored roof of the No. 3 gun turret immediately in front of the ships bridge, passed through three decks into the lower shell-handling room, and exploded there, blowing a gaping hole in the ships bottom, and tearing open a seam in the ships port side. For 30 minutes, secondary explosions in the gun room hampered fire-fighting efforts.\n\nKirwin was at his battle station as turret officer in No. 3 turret when the bomb struck. He remained behind in the turret to supervise the evacuation of as many men as possible, was overcome by heat and toxic smoke, and died at his station. Kirwin was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross.\n\nConstruction and commissioning\n\nKirwin was laid down as the Rudderow-class destroyer escort USS Kirwin (DE-229) on 14 February 1944 by the Philadelphia Navy Yard at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and was launched on 15 June 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Andrew J. Kirwin, the mother of the ships namesake. The ship was reclassified as a Crosley-class high-speed transport and redesignated APD-90 on 17 July 1944. After conversion to her new role, she was commissioned on 4 November 1945.\n\nFirst period in commission, 1945-1946\n\nAfter shakedown in the Chesapeake Bay, Kirwin cleared Norfolk, Virginia, on 29 January 1946, and arrived at Green Cove Springs, Florida, on 31 January 1946. She was decommissioned there on 6 April 1946 and placed in reserve there on the St. Johns River in the Florida Group of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet.\n\nSecond period in commission, 1965-1969\n\nIn the autumn of 1964, the high-speed transport USS Earle B. Hall (APD-107) suffered a major engineering casualty that caused her to lose all power, and she was deemed not worth repairing. Kirwin was chosen to replace her. Accordingly, on 30 November 1964, Kirwin arrived under tow at Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek at Virginia Beach, Virginia, and was berthed alongside Earle B. Hall. There Kirwin underwent reactivation, with Earle B. Halls crew readying her for recommissioning. On 15 January 1965, after almost 19 years in reserve, Kirwin was recommissioned and Earle B. Hall was simultaneously decommissioned, with Earle B. Halls crew transferring to ''Kirwin.\n\nIn February 1965, Kirwin moved to Newport News, Virginia, for overhaul. She got underway for Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on 6 July 1965 and spent the next five weeks on nuclear defense, antisubmarine warfare, and gunnery exercises. She visited San Juan, Puerto Rico, then returned to Little Creek, arriving there on 22 August 1965.\n\nOn 29 November 1965, Kirwin departed for the Caribbean to join Task Force 184 for amphibious warfare and antisubmarine exercises. She returned to Little Creek on 16 December 1965.\n\nIn 1966 Kirwin operated out of Little Creek on training exercises along the United States East Coast and in the Caribbean until heading for the Mediterranean on 15 August 1966. Arriving at Naval Station Rota at Rota, Spain, on 25 August 1966, she visited Italy, Malta, Greece, Tunisia, Spain, and Morocco before returning to Little Creek on 3 December 1966.\n\nDecommissioned Dec. 16th, 1968 Orange, Texas\n\nKirwin was reclassified as an \"amphibious transport, small\" and redesignated LPR-90 on 1 January 1969.\n\nFinal decommissioning and disposal\n\nKirwin was decommissioned in 1969. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 September 1974 and sold for scrapping on 11 August 1975 to J. R. Steel, Inc., Houston, Texas, for $79,002 (USD).",

  "Citation dynamics\n\nCitation dynamics describes the number of references received by the article or other scientific work over time. The citation dynamics is usually described by the bang, that take place 2\u20133 years after the work has been published, and the burst size spans several orders of magnitude. The presence of bursts is not consistent with other models based on preferential attachment. Those models are able to account for the skewed citation distribution but their reference accumulation is gradual.\n\nThe dynamics of scientific production has changed significantly over the past years. Due to technological progress, the number of published papers has been increasing exponentially until now. This, along with a much shorter time needed for the article to be published, has affected the citation dynamics of the modern papers. Furthermore, if the reference list of the study includes papers published in different years, older papers tend to have more citations. This may not necessarily because they are better but just because they had more time to accumulate those references.\n\nModel\n\nIt has been found that citation distributions are best described by a shifted power-law. The probability that paper represents the relative fitness of the paper. From the above formula, we can see that the total number of references that the paper can receive during its lifetime depends only on its relative fitness which is very hard to quantify.",

He was born into a family of musicians and therefore learned how to play the bongos and conga at an early age. In 1967, when he was 10 years old, he played the conga for a children's band called La Prefeida. His family moved to New York City in 1968. In New York, Vega continued to go to school. In his free time however, he played the conga for various local Latin rock bands including City Trash.\n\nLatin music was popular in New York during the 1970s and while Vega played the conga for Latin rock bands, he started to become more and more interested in the afroantillano style of music better known as salsa. He listened to and was influenced by Ismael Rivera, Rafael Cortijo, Rafael Ithier and El Gran Combo.\n\nVega started as a member of Orquesta La Preferida from 1971 to 1973. He was the primary conga player and sang coro. One year when the school season ended his parents sent him on vacation to the United States for the two months of the school recess. Upon returning to Puerto Rico and back into the band, there was a replacement on the conga tacking his place. It was suggested to Vega to go up front and try singing, as he had done coro for the band quite well. Thus, his singing career was started. He remained with the band and recorded a 45 rpm record under the supervision of the Pijuan (Melon Records) a director of Pijuan y su sexteto. He also did come coro while a member of the Willie Rosario Orquesta with Gilberto Santarosa on two songs recorded by the Orquesta La Preferida for the late promotor Rueben Haddock. His voice can be heard on the CD Al fin contra viento y marea by La Preferida.\n\nLa Selecta\n\nIn 1978, after he graduated from high school, Vega auditioned and was accepted by La Selecta, a well known salsa band directed by Raphy Leavitt. He sang with the band and recorded \"Cosquillita\" (\"Tickle\"), \"Sheila Taina\" and \"El Picaflor\", which became hits. In 1980, Vega was doing a show with La Selecta and in the audience was another salsa bandleader, Willie Rosario. Rosario was impressed with Vega and invited him to join his band. He did and participated in many recordings, and from 1981 to 1986, he shared credits with a young singer, Gilberto Santa Rosa. Vega also played an essential role in the recording of \"La Nueva Cosecha\" (\"The New Harvest\") which was nominated for a Grammy Award. He stayed with Rosario for eight years.\n\nIn 1986, Vega joined the Louie Ramirez band before returning to Puerto Rico. In Puerto Rico, he was introduced to Eddie Palmieri, by his friend Giovanni Hidalgo. Palmieri recorded Vega and ended up hiring him. Vega participated in the recording of La Verdad (The Truth), which won a Grammy Award for Palmieri. He traveled with the band to Spain, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, and Yugoslavia.\n\nSolo career\n\nIn 1988, Vega formed his own band and recorded \"solo\" for the first time. His album Yo Me Quedo! (I Will Stay) became a best seller, andappearted in the Billboard tropical/salsa chart in late 1989. He then followed that with the recording of Lo Mio es Amor (My Thing is Love), which included the songs \"Ella\" (\"She\") and an English language track \"Love is Forever\". This album earned him his first gold record. In 1991, Vega won a platinum record with the success of his album Uno Mismo (Oneself). That year he performed in Venezuela and later went to New York where in Madison Square Garden he participated in Tito Puentes 100th recording The Mambo King. He appeared at the New York Salsa Festival in 1989, 1990 and 1991.\n\nCurrently\n\nAmong his most current productions are Si me mira a los ojos (If You Look into My Eyes), Hoy vine a Cantarte (Today I Came to Sing to You), Tropical Tribute to the Beatles (1996) and La Combinacion Perfecta (The Perfect Combination).\n\nVega continues to perform but, not as often as before.

His 5 m high sculpture Boy 1999 was a feature in the Millennium Dome, and later exhibited at the 49th Venice Biennale in 2001. Today it sits in the foyer of the Danish Contemporary Art Museum ARoS in Aarhus.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2002, Mueck was Associate Artist at the National Gallery, London. During this two-year post he created the works Mother and Child, Pregnant Woman, Man in a Boat, and Swaddled Baby and culminated in an exhibition in 2003.\n\nMueck's most recent major touring exhibition began at Fondation Cartier pour l'Art Contemporain (Paris), in 2013, and travelled to Fundacion Proa, Buenos Aires., MAM, Rio de Janeiro (marking the biggest audience in the history of that museum), and S\u00e3o Paulo, exhibited at the Pinacoteca.\n\nDuring 2016, Mueck exhibited at the Theseus Temple, Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, and Sara Hild\u00e9n Art Museum, Tampere, Finland.\n\nIn 2017 Mueck had a major solo presentation at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. As part of the Hull City of Culture, Mueck's works appeared as part of SKIN, at the Ferens Art Gallery (Hull, UK), alongside paintings by Lucian Freud and \u00c9douard Manet, and Spencer Tunick's photographs of his installation Sea of Hull. The exhibition features a new work Poke, as well as Wild Man, Spooning Couple, Youth, Ghost, and Mask II.\n\nWork\n\nMueck's sculpture responds to the minute details of the human body, playing with scale to produce engrossing visual images (a style known as hyperrealism). Mueck spends a long time, sometimes more than a year, creating each sculpture. His subject matter is deeply private, and is often concerned with people's unspoken thoughts and feelings.",

  "\u015eehzade Mehmed Abid\n\n\u015eehzade Mehmed Abid (17 September 1905 \u2013 8 December 1973) was an Ottoman prince, the son of Sultan Abdul Hamid II and Saliha Naciye Han\u0131m.\n\nEarly years\n\n\u015eehzade Mehmed Abid was born on 17 September 1905 in the\u00a0Y\u0131ld\u0131z Palace. His father was\u00a0Abdul Hamid II, son of\u00a0Abdulmejid I and\u00a0Tirim\u00fcjgan Kad\u0131n. His mother was\u00a0Saliha Naciye Han\u0131m, daughter of Arslan Bey Ankuap. He was the eighth son, and sixteenth child born to his father, and the eldest child of his mother. He had a sister,\u00a0Samiye Sultan\u00a0three years younger than him, who died in infancy. He was named after Abdul Hamid's decreased brother.\n\nOn 27 April 1909, Abdul Hamid was deposed, and sent into exile in\u00a0Thessaloniki. Abid and his mother followed Abdul Hamid. There they lived in Alatini Mansion. After Thessaloniki fell to Greece in 1912, Abdul Hamid returned to Istanbul, and settled in the\u00a0Beylerbeyi Palace. His circumcision took place on 9 October 1913. Abdul Hamid died in 1918, when Abid was thirteen years of age.\n\nAbid's early education took place in\u00a0Galatasaray High School. He was thought painting by Halil Pasha, and his history tutor was Tevfik Bey. After graduating from here, he was enrolled in the\u00a0Ottoman Military College, and went on to become senior lieutenant in the imperial\u00a0Ottoman Army. He also served aide-de-camp to Sultan Mehmed VI. His mother died in 1923, when he was nineteen years of age.\n\nBetween 1918 and 1922, Abid lived in the Y\u0131ld\u0131z Palace, and between 1922 and 1924, he lived in the Erenk\u00f6y Palace.\n\nExile\n\nAt the exile if the imperial family in March 1924, Abid settled in Beirut, Lebanon. He used to spend most of the time in Jounieh with his eldest brother \u015eehzade Mehmed Selim, and the summers in Aley. He then went to Paris, where he stayed with his older sister, Ay\u015fe Sultan. Here he earned his living as a\u00a0soap seller. On 14 January 1925, he gave the power of attorney to Sami G\u00fcnzberg, a well-known Turkish Jewish lawyer, authorising him to regain from usurpers buildings, lands, mines, concessions left by Abdul Hamid situated in Turkish territory and elsewhere.\n\nIn Paris, he went to the\u00a0Sorbonne Law School, and the Faculty of\u00a0Political Sciences from where he graduated in\u00a01936\u00a0and\u00a01937 respectively. He\u00a0received\u00a0his doctorate\u00a0in\u00a0law from\u00a0Sorbonne. He also went to Ecole Nationale des Langues Orientales Vivantes, where he\u00a0graduated in Persian Language and Literature. Between 1940 and 1948, he lived for short periods in Toulouse, Nice, Madrid, Lisbon, Cairo, Alexandria and Tirana.\n\nBetween 1936 and 1939, King Zog I of Albania, appointed him the Albanian Ambassador to France.\n\nPersonal life\n\nIn 1930, Abid asked Abdulmejid II and Mehisti Han\u0131m's daughter, D\u00fcrr\u00fc\u015fehvar Sultan's hand in marriage. However, her father refused, on the grounds of D\u00fcrr\u00fc\u015fehvar being under age. In 1934, his marriage was arranged to Mihri\u015fah Sultan, daughter of \u015eehzade Yusuf Izzeddin and Leman Han\u0131m, and then to the daughter of Nizam of Hyderabad State. However, none of them materialised.\n\nAbid's first wife was P\u0131nardil Fahriye Han\u0131m. She died in 1934 in Nice, France, and was buried in Muslim Bobigny Cemetery. His second wife was Princess Senije Zogu, daughter of Xhemal Pasha Zogu\u00a0and\u00a0Sadije Toptani, and sister of\u00a0King Zog I. They were betrothed on 9 January 1936 in Tirana, and were married on 13 January 1936. They divorced in 1949.\n\nDeath\n\nIn 1966, Mehmed Abid settled in Beirut, where he died of heart attack on 8 December 1973 and was buried in the cemetery of the Sulaymaniyya Takiyya, Damascus, Syria.\n\nPersonality\n\nAbid was very smart, cultured and interested in history. In his last days he used to spend his time in libraries and bookstores. He could speak Turkish\u00a0and\u00a0French, and knew\u00a0Arabic\u00a0and\u00a0Persian \u00a0He received many offers to write down his memories about his father. However, he\u00a0turned down those offers. He would generally refuse the journalists requests to meet him. He was handsome, and would dress comely and cleanly. He spoke very little and was too modest.",

  "\u00der\u00fa\u00f0r\n\n\u00der\u00fa\u00f0r (Old Norse:, \"strength\"), sometimes anglicized as Thr\u00fad or Thrud, is a daughter of the major god Thor and the goddess Sif in Norse mythology. \u00der\u00fa\u00f0r is also the name of one of the valkyries who serve ale to the einherjar in Valhalla (Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l, stanza 36). The two may or may not be the same figure.\n\nAttestations\n\n\u00der\u00fa\u00f0r is attested in the following sources:\n\nPoetic Edda\n\nThe Poetic Edda poem Alv\u00edssm\u00e1l, in which a dwarf, Alv\u00edss, claims to be engaged to Thor's daughter, may be about \u00der\u00fa\u00f0r, but the daughter is not named.\n\nProse Edda\n\nThe Prose Edda book Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l (4) tells that Thor can be referred to by the kenning \"father of \u00der\u00fa\u00f0r\" (fa\u00f0ir \u00der\u00fa\u00f0ar). Eysteinn Valdason uses it in his poem about Thor (2). The Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l (21) adds that her mother is Sif.\n\nIn Bragi Boddason's Ragnarsdr\u00e1pa, the j\u00f6tunn Hrungnir is called \"thief of \u00der\u00fa\u00f0r\" (\u00der\u00fa\u00f0ar \u00fej\u00f3fr). But there is no direct reference to this myth in any other source. Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l (17), in which Snorri relates the fight between Thor and Hrungnir, mentions a very different cause, and \u00dej\u00f3\u00f0\u00f3lfr of Hvinir's Haustl\u00f6ng only describes the fight without giving the reason for it. This poem depicts two mythological scenes painted on a shield, the first being I\u00f0unn's abduction by the giant \u00dejazi. Margaret Clunies Ross suggested that the two episodes might be complementary, both dealing with the abduction of a goddess by a giant, its failure and the death of the abductor. Another kenning may allude to this myth: in Eil\u00edfr Go\u00f0r\u00fanarson's \u00de\u00f3rsdr\u00e1pa (18), Thor is called \"he who longs fiercely for \u00der\u00fa\u00f0r\" (\u00fer\u00e1m\u00f3\u00f0nir \u00der\u00fa\u00f0ar).\n\nKarlevi Runestone\n\n\u00der\u00fa\u00f0r is mentioned on the 10th-century Karlevi runestone on the island of \u00d6land, Sweden, where a chieftain is referred to as the \"tree of \u00der\u00fa\u00f0r\".\n\nKennings\n\nThe name \u00der\u00fa\u00f0r could be used in kennings for chieftains, as exemplified on the Karlevi Runestone. The name is also used in kennings for women. For instance, Ormr Stein\u00fe\u00f3rsson in his poem about a woman (4) uses the kenning hrosta l\u00fa\u00f0rs g\u00e6i-\u00der\u00fa\u00f0r, which, according to Anthony Faulkes, can be rendered \"keeper of the malt-box (mash-tub) or ale-vessel\".",

  "John Lake (journalist)\n\nJohn Eric Lake (born February 18, 1930 in Albany, New York - disappeared December 10, 1967) was the sports editor of Newsweek until his mysterious disappearance.\n\nPersonal background\n\nJohn Eric Lake was born February 18, 1930 in Albany, New York. He graduated in 1951 with a B.A. degree in journalism from Syracuse University, where he met his wife Alice Conlin. The couple married in 1952 while Lake was serving in the U.S. Navy in Honolulu, Hawaii. He returned to graduate school at Syracuse after he was discharged from the U.S. Navy. The couple had a daughter and a son. His wife and children later moved to New Jersey and then to Islesford, Cranberry Island, Maine. John Lake was declared missing in December 1967 and deceased by a court in New Jersey in 1975.\n\nCareer\n\nThe Binghamton News Press hired both John Lake and his wife in 1952, and he worked in sports while she wrote features. In 1959 Lake became a staff writer at the New York Herald Tribune. Lake worked with Red Smith while at the Tribune. In February 1964, he moved to Newsweek to become its sports editor. He succeeded Dick Schaap in this role. In his last year at the magazine, Lake authored three cover stories (nine in four years) on such varied topics as \"The Black Athlete\", the Indy 500 and the World Series. Lake was hired as a ghost writer for Bob Gibson's autobiography and had all but submitted the work. Lake's last issue for Newsweek was the December 11, 1967 issue with a cover featuring a dark-haired, bespectacled Robert McNamara, asked, \"Why is He Leaving?\" After Lake's disappearance in 1967, he was replaced as sports editor six months later by Pete Axthelm, a writer for Sports Illustrated.\n\nDisappearance\n\nJohn Lake was last seen in midtown Manhattan, New York City, on December 10, 1967. At that time, he was walking toward the subway to go home. A missing persons report was filed by his wife, Alice, four days later. His disappearance was investigated by the Pinkerton Detective Agency, which was hired by Newsweek. Years after, a police officer from missing persons showed his son a February 1968 photo of a corpse who closely resembled Lake but could not be positively identified.\n\nMissing Person documents:\n\nReactions\n\nLake was admired by other journalists and athletes. Peter Benchley, author and screenwriter, who edited the Radio/TV section at Newsweek at the time, admitted to being intimidated by him. Mario Andretti, auto race driver, called him the most prepared journalist from the national media that ever interviewed him. Bert Sugar, boxing raconteur, recalls it was John Lake that moved press conferences from showmanship to seriousness with a single question.",
  "Evans Bay, New Zealand\n\nEvans Bay, located in Wellington Harbour, New Zealand, between the Miramar Peninsula and Hataitai, was the site of New Zealand's first patent slip and served as Wellington's international flying-boat terminal from 1938 until 1956. It is named after George Samuel Evans, an early Wellington settler.\n\nGeography\n\nEvans Bay is a large U-shaped bay within Wellington Harbour. Within the bay are smaller features such as Balaena Bay, Hataitai Beach and Shelly Bay. Prior to the Haowhenua earthquake in about 1460 AD, Miramar was an island and Evans Bay would have been open to Lyall Bay. Today it is bounded by the Miramar peninsula to the east, the Rongotai isthmus to the south, and a hilly ridge forming part of Hataitai to the west. Formerly the Waipapa Stream flowed from the valley in Hataitai into the head of Evans Bay near the bluff at Wellington Road, creating a large swampy delta. The shoreline of the bay in this area was known by M\u0101ori as Te Akau-tangi (\"the crying shore\", or \"the murmuring shore\"). An 1890 map names the beach at the head of the bay as Tangahakau Beach. Another M\u0101ori name suggested for Evans Bay is Kokotahi te Taniwha. Considerable reclamation has been undertaken at the southern end of the bay. Kilbirnie Park and Cobham Drive sit on reclaimed land.\n\nEvans Bay as an unofficial Wellington suburb nestles at the western side of the bay between Hataitai, Kilbirnie and Rongotai. Evans Bay Intermediate School takes its name from the general area.\n\nPatent slip\n\nWith the increase of steamships on international routes from the mid-nineteenth century, Wellington Chamber of Commerce believed that mail liners would visit Wellington if the city had slipway facilities. In 1866 a British firm named Kennards sent hundreds of tonnes of machinery to Evans Bay but there was a dispute and the equipment sat there for five years until locals backed by British investors formed the Wellington Patent Slip Company (WPSCo). Construction began in 1871 and was completed in May 1873.\n\nThe Evans Bay Patent Slip, the first in New Zealand, was a great engineering feat. A 200-ton, 180 foot (54.9 metres) long cradle ran on wheels along a set of rails. Two chains were used for hauling vessels out of the water and lowering them back down. The chains worked on a cogwheel winch which was powered by two steam engines. Construction above the high tide mark was straightforward, but work underwater was far more difficult, requiring accurate work by divers in diving bells who could only work in good weather conditions. This was the first large-scale underwater construction in New Zealand. A 500 foot (154.2 metre) jetty was also erected to improve communication with ships. Along with the winch houses and boiler rooms associated with the slipways were houses, a store, inspector\u2019s office and carpenter\u2019s shop, a messroom and a blacksmith\u2019s shop.\n\nOn 2 May 1873 the 316-ton barque Cyprus was the first ship to use the slipway. Ships of 2000 tons or more could be winched up the slip, but without the expected big Panama liners, most ships were smaller and less profitable. In 1908 Wellington Harbour Board purchased the assets of the Wellington Patent Slip Company and leased the operation to the Union Steam Ship Company, with conditions that a second slip be built. This was constructed in 1922. In 1961 the Union Steamship Company decided not to renew its lease. The Harbour Board took over running both slips until 1969, when slipway No. 1 was taken out of service and slipway No. 2 was upgraded. The slipway finally closed on 31 July 1980. The site was demolished and various equipment scrapped, sold or given to museums, and land was filled in for a new housing subdivision. In 2003 Wellington City Council applied to rezone the site as a heritage area, and the area is now known as Cog Park.\n\nUnion Steam Ship Company, Greta Point\n\nDuring 1910 \u2013 1911 the Union Steam Ship Company reclaimed land at Greta Point next to the Patent Slip and constructed a large complex of buildings, including a laundry, workshops, a sawmill and upholstery department. All of the company's laundry in New Zealand was handled by the site at Evans Bay. By 1981 all but one building had been demolished, and the former store became a bar and restaurant known as the Greta Point Tavern. In 2003 it was moved in pieces in 11 trips by barge to a site on Queens Wharf in the inner city. Not much remains of the original building except the exterior. As of 2022 the relocated building houses Foxglove bar and restaurant. The land at Greta Point was used for apartment buildings.\n\nPower station\n\nIn the early 1920s a coal-fired power station was built at Shag Point in Evans Bay (approximately near the roundabout at the intersection of Calabar Road and Cobham Drive). It began full operation in May 1924 and was shut down in 1968. Coke breeze ( a coal by-product) from the power station was used as infill for reclamation at the Evans Bay Yacht Club site. While the power station was unpopular due to its unsightliness and emissions, its outlet pipes discharged warm water into Evans Bay which was enjoyed by bathers.\n\nFlying boats\n\nEvans Bay functioned as the preferred flying-boat alighting area in Wellington Harbour during the 1930s, and local officials promoted it through the decade as such. However a 1938 report concluded that although Evans Bay was the best site for flying boats in Wellington Harbour, it was subject to strong winds that would make a regular service unviable. Visits from Imperial Airways aircraft took place in 1938 as well as from Pan American types. In 1940 Tasman Empire Airways Limited (TEAL) flew one of their two Short Empire flying boats to Evans Bay with dignitaries who attended the nearby New Zealand Centennial Exhibition located at Rongotai.\n\nAlthough RNZAF Short Sunderland and Consolidated Catalina flying-boat operations flew intermittently through the 1940s from their seaplane base at Shelly Bay located on the western side of the Miramar Peninsula, it was not until 1950 that TEAL (the forerunner to the national airline Air New Zealand), operated a permanent overseas service to Australia from Evans Bay.\n\nA temporary terminal was provided by using roadside parking-garages along Evans Bay Parade at the sheltered western end of the bay next to the patent slip, until a more substantial terminal facility was constructed for TEAL on reclaimed land in 1951. TEAL installed a \"Braby\" pontoon dock to allow easier boarding and light maintenance of the Short Solent flying boats that TEAL used at the time. Evans Bay could become quite rough in unfavourable weather conditions and at least one Solent was damaged during alighting, needing substantial repairs.\n\nServices to the Chatham Islands also operated from Evans Bay, using aircraft from TEAL and Ansett Airways as well as the RNZAF. A proposal for a peak-time domestic service to Auckland by National Airways Corporation in 1949 using Short Sandringham flying boats to make up for the 1947 closure of Rongotai Airport was turned down as uneconomic compared to DC-3 operations 35 mi away at the present-day Kapiti Coast airport.\n\nNearby Rongotai airfield provided air-traffic control for the alighting area. As advances in aviation overtook the flying-boat concept, TEAL switched to landplane operations and the Evans Bay terminal closed in 1956. Also at the time, Rongotai airfield started undergoing total redevelopment into today's Wellington International Airport, which opened in 1959. An original concept involved developing a joint landbase and flying-boat airport, but this did not come to fruition.\n\nMeridian Wind Sculpture Walk\n\nThe Wind Sculpture Walk consists of five wind-activated sculptures installed along Cobham Drive at the head of Evans Bay between 2001 and 2010. The sculptures and walkway were the result of a partnership between the Wellington Sculpture Trust, Wellington City Council and Meridian Energy. The area gets a lot of wind and the kinetic sculptures celebrate this. The five sculptures are Zephyrometer, Urban Forest, Akau Tangi, Tower of Light, and Pacific Grass\n\nEvans Bay Marina\n\nEvans Bay Marina is situated at the southern end of Evans Bay. It has four piers with walk-on access to 141 berths for boats between 6 and 20m long. The marina is managed by Wellington City Council. Wellington Volunteer Coastguard operates from a base at the marina.\n\nEvans Bay Yacht and Motor Boat Club\n\nEvans Bay Yacht and Motor Boat Club has premises next to the marina on the western side of the bay, including a hall that can be hired by the public. The club was founded in 1919.\n\nBalaena Bay and Hataitai Beach\n\nBalaena Bay and Hataitai Beach, two small sheltered bays on the western side of Evans Bay, have been popular sunbathing and swimming locations for many years. Both areas have changing rooms and toilets, and Balaena Bay has a carpark. The Hataitai Bathing Club (now known as the Hataitai Amateur Swimming Club) was formed in 1908 and for many years ran swimming lessons and competitions from Hataitai Beach. The club built a private clubhouse in 1912 which",

  "South Holland and The Deepings (UK Parliament constituency)\n\nSouth Holland and The Deepings is a constituency represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament, since its 1997 creation, by John Hayes, a Conservative.\n\nAt the 2017 general election, the constituency recorded a higher Conservative share of the vote than any constituency since 1970, with 69.9% of voters backing the party. South Holland also delivered the nation's second highest Leave vote in the 2016 referendum on the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union. 73.6% of voters endorsed Britain's withdrawal from the EU, second only to neighbouring Boston. At the 2019 general election, the Conservative majority was 62.7%, the highest of any Conservative in any constituency in any general election since Kensington South in 1955. Hayes took 75.9% of the vote, the third highest for the Conservatives only after Castle Point in Essex and Boston and Skegness.\n\nBoundaries\n\n1997\u20132010: The District of South Holland, with the wards of Deeping St James, Market Deeping, West Deeping and Truesdale, which are all in the District of South Kesteven.\n\n2010\u2013present: The District of South Holland, with Deeping St James, Market Deeping and West Deeping.\n\nThe constituency was created in 1997 from parts of the former seats of Holland with Boston and Stamford and Spalding. It covers the area around Spalding. It roughly corresponds to the local government District of South Holland, but with Market Deeping, Deeping St James and West Deeping added.\n\nIn minor boundary changes that were put in place for the 2010 general election, parts of the two civil parishes of Baston and Langtoft, forming much of the Truesdale ward, were moved to the neighbouring constituency of Grantham and Stamford. This made Market Deeping and Deeping St James the only South Kesteven parishes to stay in the constituency, the remainder being in South Holland District.\n\nHistory\n\nThe last non-Conservative member for the predecessor main seat was Sir Herbert Butcher (served 1937\u20131966) who for much of that time was in the National Liberal Party set up in 1931.\n\nThe member from 1966 until 1997 was Richard Body for the main contributor seat (in later years as MP, knighted), who had previously been an MP during the Eden government and the start of the Macmillan government for Billericay, and later wrote assertive books on agriculture and on the Common Agricultural Policy.\n\nIn the 2017 general election, the seat returned the highest vote share for the Conservatives nationally at 69.9%. In the 2019 general election, it was an extremely safe Conservative seat. It had the largest percentage majority, third-largest absolute majority, and third-largest Conservative vote share of any seat held by the party; nationally the seat had the eleventh-largest percentage majority of any constituency.\n\nConstituency profile\n\nWorkless claimants were in November 2012 significantly lower than the national average of 3.8%, at 2.8% of the population based on a statistical compilation by The Guardian.",

  "The Legend of Huainanzi\n\nThe Legend of Huainanzi (originally titled \u6dee\u5357\u5b50\u4f20\u5947) is a TV animation series produced by CCTV Animation Co. LTD, Huainan Media Industry Development Centre and Communication University of China. This 52-episode epic-historical-fantasy series is based on Chinese philosophical classic Huainanzi and is broadcast by CCTV-Children.\n\nSynopsis\n\nDuring the ancient Western Han dynasty (206BC-9AD), a series of disasters caused by occult phenomena swept across the entire world. Huainanzi, the mysterious Chinese book bound in bamboo, was ripped apart and sent through time to different historical junctures. The book pieces were transformed into various objects, waiting to be rediscovered.\n\nA hundred years later, a young man, named Hong Lie lifts up the burden to collect the missing pieces of the ancient bamboo book. With the help of Ba Gong and his friends, going through the Gate of 24 Solar Terms, Hong Lie travels through dynasties to search for the lost pieces.\n\nIn his adventure, Hong Lie and his loyal friends, Ji Ming and Gou Tiao, together experienced the greatness of the ancient legends, appreciating the wisdom of the ancestors from Chun Qiu Period, and witnessed all the weird things happening among ordinary people. Warmth and coldness, sadness and happiness, separation and reunion, stories led him to the great world in the book Huainanzi and through exciting adventures he made lifelong friends. In this special way, Hong Lie communicated with ancestors and started to see the principle of world, realizing that obeying the laws of nature and being in harmony with the environment was the right thing to do. A simple collecting journey slowly became a challenging trip for him to go on with his family mission, and inherit the ancestor's spirit.\n\nMain Character\n\nHong Lie\n\nA 12-year-old naughty boy, with a direct and straight character, he is a big fan of playing tricks, but inside him is kind and faithful soul. He has a strong sense of justice, when unfair things occur, he would definitely fight against them. As long as he made up his mind on something, no one or nothing could ever stop him. Since he never cares for the consequences, most goodies would be turned into disasters because of him, and often the situation would fall out of control. Li Qi\n\nA 15-year-old pretty girl, innocent and romantic, she is the real first-chair in the family, doing all the chores and maintaining the daily order. She also needs to take care of Ba Gong and educate her younger brother. She is always gentle and nice to other people, however when it comes to her naughty brother Hong Lie, she would go crazy, and of course, two of them are always fighting.\n\nBa Gong\n\nHe is a weird old man of over an hundred years old, moody and unpredictable, he is always absorbed in his own thoughts. He loves to play small tricks, and doing unexpected things, people are already used to his craziness.\n\nHe never seems to worry about Hong Lie or Li Qi at all, he lets them do whatever they want, and treats them like friends. He believes that everyone has their own destiny and as long as one can enjoy his life, that's fine. However, if anything relates to the bamboo book happens, he would take it very serious and suddenly become another man.\n\nJi Ming\n\nHe was once a fighting rooster of the royal court, then went to heaven with Liu An and was known as the Vermilion Bird. However, after that he got banished to the man's world and ever since then he became an ordinary rooster. He can't stand the mocking of fate and swears to go back to heaven. Therefore, he's always so eager about travelling back through time, and for this reason, he is sometimes way too utilitarian and selfish. He's quite clever, and the thing he hates the most is being treated as an ordinary rooster. Gou Tiao\n\nHe loves to sleep, loves to droll, and rarely talks, but when he starts to say something in that fairly slow speed, those simple words always reveals the reality and the truth. Usually he seems to be lazy and casual, nothing could ever surprise him. However, when trapped in dangerous situations, he would become ferocious in a second and get ready to fight. Once the alert canceled, he would go back to that sleepy face again. In addition, his loyalty to Hong Lie cannot be doubted.",

  "Scrum cap\n\nThe scrum cap is a form of headgear used by rugby players to protect the ears in the scrum, which can otherwise suffer injuries leading to the condition commonly known as cauliflower ears. Although originally designed for forwards they are now worn by players of all positions, even those who do not play in the scrum.\n\nA simpler alternative to a cap, or a head-cap and used by many players, is a thin strip of foam or cloth and electrical tape wrapped around the ears like a head band.\n\nConstruction\n\nThe scrum cap was first used by the Christ's College Finchley's 1st XV, and Eurig Evans is credited with its design. The traditional scrum cap was constructed of a thin cloth helmet with padding over the ears, held in place by a strap&mdash;but modern models are typically made from thin foam.\n\nThe headgear is defined by Regulation 12 of Word Rugby as being made of soft, thin materials. Stiff materials, such as plastics, are forbidden, and buckles are not permitted. Regulation 12[2] also gives details regarding the testing standards for this headgear. All headgear to be worn in rugby union must carry a World Rugby approval logo.\n\nConcussive protection\n\nSince the early 1990s, other players have taken to wearing padded headgear. This is intended to protect from cuts and head injuries that can occur from incidental contact in tackles or at rucks. Whilst they may prevent some cuts and abrasions, such headgear has not been shown to reduce concussive injury.\n\nLegislation\n\nWorld Rugby has not made scrum caps compulsory, and many players and officials are divided over their utility. Former England captain Mike Tindall criticised their usage by youth players, saying that they had a detrimental result on tackling ability from an early age. Welsh player Jonathan Davies similarly felt that they should not be compulsory, as injuries were part of the game. High profile referee Nigel Owens has however suggested making the wearing of headgear compulsory for all players, and they are mandatory for all players in Japanese youth teams.",

  "Surface condenser\n\nA surface condenser is a water-cooled shell and tube heat exchanger installed to condense exhaust steam from a steam turbine in thermal power stations. These condensers are heat exchangers which convert steam from its gaseous to its liquid state at a pressure below atmospheric pressure. Where cooling water is in short supply, an air-cooled condenser is often used. An air-cooled condenser is however, significantly more expensive and cannot achieve as low a steam turbine exhaust pressure (and temperature) as a water-cooled surface condenser.\n\nSurface condensers are also used in applications and industries other than the condensing of steam turbine exhaust in power plants.\n\nPurpose\n\nIn thermal power plants, the purpose of a surface condenser is to condense the exhaust steam from a steam turbine to obtain maximum efficiency, and also to convert the turbine exhaust steam into pure water (referred to as steam condensate) so that it may be reused in the steam generator or boiler as boiler feed water.\n\nThe steam turbine itself is a device to convert the heat in steam to mechanical power. The difference between the heat of steam per unit mass at the inlet to the turbine and the heat of steam per unit mass at the outlet from the turbine represents the heat which is converted to mechanical power. Therefore, the more the conversion of heat per pound or kilogram of steam to mechanical power in the turbine, the better is its efficiency. By condensing the exhaust steam of a turbine at a pressure below atmospheric pressure, the steam pressure drop between the inlet and exhaust of the turbine is increased, which increases the amount of heat available for conversion to mechanical power. Most of the heat liberated due to condensation of the exhaust steam is carried away by the cooling medium (water or air) used by the surface condenser.\n\nDiagram of water-cooled surface condenser\n\nThe adjacent diagram depicts a typical water-cooled surface condenser as used in power stations to condense the exhaust steam from a steam turbine driving an electrical generator as well in other applications. There are many fabrication design variations depending on the manufacturer, the size of the steam turbine, and other site-specific conditions.\n\nShell\n\nThe shell is the condenser's outermost body and contains the heat exchanger tubes. The shell is fabricated from carbon steel plates and is stiffened as needed to provide rigidity for the shell. When required by the selected design, intermediate plates are installed to serve as baffle plates that provide the desired flow path of the condensing steam. The plates also provide support that help prevent sagging of long tube lengths.\n\nAt the bottom of the shell, where the condensate collects, an outlet is installed. In some designs, a sump (often referred to as the hotwell) is provided. Condensate is pumped from the outlet or the hotwell for reuse as boiler feedwater.\n\nFor most water-cooled surface condensers, the shell is under [partial] vacuum during normal operating conditions.\n\nVacuum system\n\nFor water-cooled surface condensers, the shell's internal vacuum is most commonly supplied by and maintained by an external steam jet ejector system. Such an ejector system uses steam as the motive fluid to remove any non-condensible gases that may be present in the surface condenser. The Venturi effect, which is a particular case of Bernoulli's principle, applies to the operation of steam jet ejectors.\n\nMotor driven mechanical vacuum pumps, such as the liquid ring type, are also popular for this service.\n\nTube sheets\n\nAt each end of the shell, a sheet of sufficient thickness usually made of stainless steel is provided, with holes for the tubes to be inserted and rolled. The inlet end of each tube is also bellmouthed for streamlined entry of water. This is to avoid eddies at the inlet of each tube giving rise to erosion, and to reduce flow friction. Some makers also recommend plastic inserts at the entry of tubes to avoid eddies eroding the inlet end. In smaller units some manufacturers use ferrules to seal the tube ends instead of rolling. To take care of length wise expansion of tubes some designs have expansion joint between the shell and the tube sheet allowing the latter to move longitudinally. In smaller units some sag is given to the tubes to take care of tube expansion with both end water boxes fixed rigidly to the shell.\n\nTubes\n\nGenerally the tubes are made of stainless steel, copper alloys such as brass or bronze, cupro nickel, or titanium depending on several selection criteria. The use of copper bearing alloys such as brass or cupro nickel is rare in new plants, due to environmental concerns of toxic copper alloys. Also depending on the steam cycle water treatment for the boiler, it may be desirable to avoid tube materials containing copper. Titanium condenser tubes are usually the best technical choice, however the use of titanium condenser tubes has been virtually eliminated by the sharp increases in the costs for this material. The tube lengths range to about 85 ft (26 m) for modern power plants, depending on the size of the condenser. The size chosen is based on transportability from the manufacturers\u2019 site and ease of erection at the installation site. The outer diameter of condenser tubes typically ranges from 3/4 inch to 1-1/4 inch, based on condenser cooling water friction considerations and overall condenser size.\n\nWaterboxes\n\nThe tube sheet at each end with tube ends rolled, for each end of the condenser is closed by a fabricated box cover known as a waterbox, with flanged connection to the tube sheet or condenser shell. The waterbox is usually provided with man holes on hinged covers to allow inspection and cleaning.\n\nThese waterboxes on inlet side will also have flanged connections for cooling water inlet butterfly valves, small vent pipe with hand valve for air venting at higher level, and hand-operated drain valve at bottom to drain the waterbox for maintenance. Similarly on the outlet waterbox the cooling water connection will have large flanges, butterfly valves, vent connection also at higher level and drain connections at lower level. Similarly thermometer pockets are located at inlet and outlet pipes for local measurements of cooling water temperature.\n\nIn smaller units, some manufacturers make the condenser shell as well as waterboxes of cast iron.\n\nCorrosion\n\nOn the cooling water side of the condenser:\n\nThe tubes, the tube sheets and the water boxes may be made up of materials having different compositions and are always in contact with circulating water. This water, depending on its chemical composition, will act as an electrolyte between the metallic composition of tubes and water boxes. This will give rise to electrolytic corrosion which will start from more anodic materials first.\n\nSea water based condensers, in particular when sea water has added chemical pollutants, have the worst corrosion characteristics. River water with pollutants are also undesirable for condenser cooling water.\n\nThe corrosive effect of sea or river water has to be tolerated and remedial methods have to be adopted. One method is the use of sodium hypochlorite, or chlorine, to ensure there is no marine growth on the pipes or the tubes. This practice must be strictly regulated to make sure the circulating water returning to the sea or river source is not affected.\n\nOn the steam (shell) side of the condenser:\n\nThe concentration of undissolved gases is high over air zone tubes. Therefore, these tubes are exposed to higher corrosion rates. Some times these tubes are affected by stress corrosion cracking, if original stress is not fully relieved during manufacture. To overcome these effects of corrosion some manufacturers provide higher corrosive resistant tubes in this area.\n\nEffects of corrosion\n\nAs the tube ends get corroded there is the possibility of cooling water leakage to the steam side contaminating the condensed steam or condensate, which is harmful to steam generators. The other parts of water boxes may also get affected in the long run requiring repairs or replacements involving long duration shut-downs.\n\nProtection from corrosion\n\nCathodic protection is typically employed to overcome this problem. Sacrificial anodes of zinc (being cheapest) plates are mounted at suitable places inside the water boxes. These zinc plates will get corroded first being in the lowest range of anodes. Hence these zinc anodes require periodic inspection and replacement. This involves comparatively less down time. The water boxes made of steel plates are also protected inside by epoxy paint.\n\nEffects of tube side fouling\n\nAs one might expect, with millions of gallons of circulating water flowing through the condenser tubing from seawater or fresh water, anything that is contained within the water flowing through the tubes can ultimately end up on either the condenser tubesheet (discussed previously) or within the tubing itself. Tube-side fouling for surface condensers falls into five main categories; particulate fouling like silt and sediment, biofouling like slime and biofilms, scaling and crystallization such as calcium carbonate, macrofouling which can include anything from zebra mussels that can grow on the tubesheet, to wood or other debris that blocks the tubing, and finally, corrosion products (discussed previously).\n\nDepending on the extent of the fouling, the impact can be quite severe on the condenser's ability to condense the exhaust steam coming from the turbine. As fouling builds up within the tubing, an insulating effect is created and the heat-transfer characteristics of the tubes are diminished, often requiring the turbine to be slowed to a point where the condenser can handle the exhaust steam produced. Typically, this can be quite costly to power plants in the form of reduced output, increase fuel consumption and increased CO2 emissions. This \"derating\" of the turbine to accommodate the condenser's fouled or blocked tubing is an indication that the plant needs to clean the tubing in",

  "Megalonyx\n\nMegalonyx (Greek, \"large claw\") is an extinct genus of ground sloths of the family Megalonychidae, native to North America during the Pliocene and Pleistocene epochs. It became extinct during the Quaternary extinction event at the end of the Rancholabrean of the Pleistocene, living from ~5 million to 11,000 years ago. The type species, M. jeffersonii, measured about 3 m and weighed up to 1000 kg. Megalonyx is descended from Pliometanastes, a genus of ground sloth that had arrived in North America during the Late Miocene, prior to the Great American Biotic Interchange. Megalonyx had the widest distribution of any North American ground sloth, having a range encompassing most of the contiguous United States, extending as far north as Alaska during warm periods.\n\nTaxonomy\n\nIn 1796, Colonel John Stuart sent Thomas Jefferson, then Vice President of the United States, some fossil bones: a femur fragment, ulna, radius, and foot bones including three large claws. The discoveries were made in a cave in Greenbrier County, Virginia (present-day West Virginia). Jefferson examined the bones and presented his observations in the paper \"A Memoir on the Discovery of Certain Bones of a Quadruped of the Clawed Kind in the Western Parts of Virginia\" to the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia on March 10, 1797. In the paper, he named the then unknown animal Megalonyx (\"giant claw\") and compared each recovered bone to the corresponding bone in a lion. Jefferson did not attempt a definitive taxonomic classification and kept an open mind, writing \u201cLet us only say then, what we may safely say, that he was more than three times as large as the lion\u201d. In his postscript, Jefferson mentions the remains of a Megatherium discovered in Paraguay and notes its anatomical similarities to Megalonyx.\n\nContrary to the scientific consensus emerging at the time that extinction had played an important role in natural history, Jefferson believed in a \"completeness of nature\" whose inherent balance did not allow species to go extinct naturally. He asked Lewis and Clark, as they planned their famous expedition in 1804\u20131806, to keep an eye out for living specimens of Megalonyx, as this would support his case. His idea made no headway and was later shown to be incorrect. His presentation to the American Philosophical Society in 1797 is often credited as the beginning of vertebrate paleontology in North America. In 1799, Caspar Wistar correctly identified the remains as those of a giant ground sloth. In 1822, Wistar proposed naming the species Megalonyx jeffersonii in honor of the former statesman. Desmarest then published it as such. Megalonyx was first formally named by Richard Harlan in 1825.\n\nRecent research confirms that the sloth bones were discovered in Haynes Cave in Monroe County, West Virginia. For many decades in the twentieth century, the reported origin of Jefferson's \"Certain Bones\" was Organ Cave in what is now Greenbrier County, West Virginia. This story was popularized in the 1920s by a local man, Andrew Price of Marlinton. The story came under scrutiny when in 1993 two fragments of a Megalonyx scapula were found in Haynes Cave in neighboring Monroe County. Smithsonian paleontologist Frederick Grady presented evidence in 1995 confirming Haynes Cave as the original source of Jefferson's fossil. Jefferson reported that the bones had been found by saltpeter workers. He gave the cave owner's name as Frederic Crower. Correspondence between Jefferson and Colonel Stuart, who sent him the bones, indicates that the cave was located about five miles from Stuart's home and that it contained saltpeter vats. An investigation of property ownership records revealed \"Frederic Crower\" to be an apparent misspelling of the name Frederic Gromer. Organ Cave was never owned by Gromer, but Haynes Cave was. Two letters written by Tristram Patton, the subsequent owner of Haynes Cave, indicate that this cave was located in Monroe County near Second Creek. Monroe County had originally been part of Greenbrier County; it became a separate county shortly after the discovery of the bones. In his own letters Patton described the cave and indicated that more fossil bones remained inside.\n\nM. jeffersonii is still the most commonly identified species of Megalonyx. It was designated the state fossil of West Virginia in 2008.\n\nM. leptostomus, named by Cope (1893), lived from the Blancan to the Irvingtonian. This species lived from Florida to Texas, north to Kansas and Nebraska, and west to New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington. It is about half the size of M. jeffersonii. It evolved into M. wheatleyi, the direct ancestor of M. jeffersonii. Species gradually got larger, with different species mostly based on size and geologic age.\n\nEvolution\n\nThe first wave of Megalonychids came to North America by island-hopping across the Central American Seaway from South America, where ground sloths arose, prior to formation of the Panamanian land bridge. Based on molecular results, its closest living relatives are the three-toed sloths (Bradypus); earlier morphological investigations came to a different conclusion.\n\nM. jeffersonii lived from the Illinoian Stage during the Middle Pleistocene (150,000 years BP) through to the Rancholabrean of the Late Pleistocene (11,000 BP ). It belongs to the genus Megalonyx, a name proposed by Thomas Jefferson, future president of the United States, in 1797. (Jefferson's surname was appended to the animal as the specific epithet in 1822 by the French zoologist Anselme Ga\u00ebtan Desmarest.) M. jeffersonii was probably descended from M. wheatleyi.\n\nDescription\n\nMegalonyx was a large, heavily built herbivore about 3 m long. Its maximum weight is estimated at 1000 kg. This is medium-sized among the giant ground sloths. Like other ground sloths, it had a blunt snout, massive jaw, and large peg-like teeth. The hind limbs were plantigrade (flat-footed) and this, along with its stout tail, allowed it to rear up into a semi-erect position to feed on tree leaves. The forelimbs had three highly developed claws that were probably used to strip leaves and tear off branches.\n\nPaleobiology\n\nDuring excavations at Tarkio Valley in southwest Iowa, an adult Megalonyx was found in direct association with two juveniles of different ages, suggesting that adults cared for young of different generations.\n\nHabitat\n\nMegalonyx ranged over much of North and Central America. Their remains have been found as far north as Alaska and the Yukon during interglacial intervals.\n\nM. jeffersonii, also known as Jefferson's ground sloth, was apparently the most wide-ranging giant ground sloth. Fossils are known from many Pleistocene sites in the United States, including most of the states east of the Rocky Mountains as well as along the west coast. It was the only ground sloth to range as far north as the present-day Yukon. Jefferson's ground sloth dwelled primarily in woodlands and forest, although they likely occupied a variety of habitats within these broad systems. Two recent studies were able to link directly dated specimens from the terminal Pleistocene with regional paleoenvironmental records, demonstrating that these particular animals were associated with spruce dominated, mixed conifer-hardwood habitat.\n\nIn late 2010, the first specimen ever found in Colorado was discovered at the Ziegler Reservoir site near Snowmass Village (in the Rocky Mountains at an elevation of 8874 feet). The Firelands ground sloth fossil dated between 11,727 and 11,424 BCE represents the earliest-known hunting activity by Ohioan Paleo-Indians.",

  "Mauro De Mauro\n\nMauro De Mauro (6 September 1921 \u2013 disappeared 16 September 1970) was an Italian investigative journalist. Originally a supporter of Benito Mussolini's Fascist regime, De Mauro eventually became a journalist with the left-leaning newspaper L'Ora in Palermo. He disappeared in September 1970 and his body has never been found. The disappearance and probable death of the \"inconvenient journalist\" (giornalista scomodo) \u2013 as he became known as a result of his investigative reporting \u2013 remains one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in modern Italian history.\n\nSeveral explanations for De Mauro's disappearance are current. One is related to the death of Enrico Mattei, the president of Italy's state-owned oil and gas conglomerate ENI. Another is that De Mauro had discovered a drug trafficking network between Sicily and the United States. A third explanation links his disappearance with the Golpe Borghese, a 1970 foiled right-wing coup d'\u00e9tat. De Mauro was apparently convinced that he had got hold of a story of a lifetime and had told colleagues at L'Ora, \"I have a scoop that is going to shake Italy.\"\n\nFascist past\n\nMauro De Mauro was born in 1921 in Foggia, Apulia. His father Oscar De Mauro belonged to a reputable family of doctors and pharmacists that had been living in Foggia for several generations. His mother Clementina Rispoli came from Naples and was a math teacher. His younger brother Tullio De Mauro (31 March 1932 \u2013 5 January 2017) was a linguist and politician who became Minister of Education in 2000-2001.\n\nDe Mauro was a supporter of the Fascist regime of Benito Mussolini. After the armistice with the Allied Forces in September 1943, he choose to follow the hard-line fascist regime of the Italian Social Republic (Repubblica Sociale Italiana, or RSI) in German-held northern Italy. During the German military occupation of Rome in 1943-1944, he was vice-commander of police under the Commander Caruso, informant of Captain Erich Priebke and Colonel Herbert Kappler of the SS. De Mauro was also a member of the Koch Band, a special unit of the Home Security in the RSI. Using a variety of aliases, De Mauro managed to infiltrate several resistance organizations in Rome and Milan in order to hunt the partisans.\n\nDe Mauro and his wife Elda volunteered to join the Decima MAS, a brutal anti-partisan force under the command of Prince Junio Valerio Borghese, also known as the \"Black Prince\". He worked for the journal La Cambusa (The Galley) of the propaganda unit of the military formation. De Mauro was arrested during the liberation in Milan in April 1945. He escaped from the prison camp Coltano (Tuscany) in December 1945 and took refuge in Naples with his young wife, along with his two daughters, Junia and Franca Valeria (the names referred to Junio Valerio Borghese). Accused of having participated in the Fosse Ardeatine massacre in March 1944 in which 335 people were executed, he was absolved by the court in 1948.\n\nJournalist in Sicily\n\nIn 1948, De Mauro moved to Palermo, Sicily, under an assumed name, and worked for local newspapers such as Il Tempo di Sicilia and Il Mattino di Sicilia. In 1959 he started working for L'Ora, a communist-oriented paper. Other journalists were puzzled about De Mauro's presence at the newspaper, as he had been a supporter of Mussolini until the bitter end and fought in the brutal war against the anti-Fascist partisans. Rumour had it that his nose had been broken by partisans.\n\nAt L'Ora, De Mauro joined a group of crack investigative reporters that included Felice Chilanti and Mario Farinella. From the mid-1950s to the 1970s, the left-leaning newspaper often hit the national spotlight for its investigations and denunciations of ties between corrupt politicians and the Sicilian Mafia. In 1960 De Mauro was among the winners of the Premiolino, one of the most important Italian journalism awards, for his crime investigations. De Mauro also wrote pieces on drug trafficking and on the Sack of Palermo, the construction boom in the 1950s and 1960s that led to the destruction of the city's green belt and ancient villas.\n\nIn 1962, De Mauro was the first to publish a detailed map of the Mafia, which was confirmed 22 years later by the Mafia pentito (turncoat) Tommaso Buscetta in his testimony to Judge Giovanni Falcone. In January 1962 he published a series of articles in L'Ora disclosing the testimony of Melchiorre Allegra, a medical doctor and a member of the Mafia from 1916 until his arrest in 1937. Upon being arrested, Allegra disclosed his membership and testified about Mafia activities. It was one of the first testimonies about the Mafia from within, but the document had been neglected until De Mauro republished it.\n\nAfter these and other revelations, De Mauro became a target for the Mafia. \"De Mauro was a walking corpse,\" said Buscetta. \"Cosa Nostra had been forced to 'forgive' the journalist because his death would arouse too much suspicion, but at the first opportunity he would have to pay for the scoop. The death sentence had only been temporarily suspended.\"\n\nMattei affair\n\nIn 1962, De Mauro investigated the mysterious death of Enrico Mattei, the powerful president of Italy's state-owned oil and gas conglomerate ENI, who died in suspicious circumstances in a plane crash on 27 October. During his controversial tenure of ENI, Mattei had tried to break the oligopoly of the \"Seven Sisters\" (a term Mattei coined to refer to the dominant oil companies of the mid-20th century ), and in 1959, in the middle of the Cold War, brokered an oil import deal with the Soviet Union over intense protests from the United States and NATO, while supporting independence movements against colonial powers such as Algeria. The U.S. National Security Council described Mattei as an irritation and an obstacle in a classified report from 1958, while the French could not forgive Mattei for his Algeria involvement. Responsibility for his death has been attributed to the Mafia, the CIA, and the French nationalist group the Organisation arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te (OAS).\n\nIn September 1970, De Mauro was again investigating the case upon request of the movie director Francesco Rosi for the movie Il caso Mattei (The Mattei Affair), which would eventually be released in 1972. He was convinced that Mattei's aircraft had been sabotaged and looked into possible links between the Mafia and the crash. Two days before his disappearance, De Mauro interviewed Graziano Verzotto, a Christian Democrat politician and former right-hand man of Mattei as head of public relations for ENI. Verzotto knew Mafia boss Giuseppe Di Cristina quite well; he had been best man at De Cristina's wedding. Verzotto had been with Mattei on his airplane the day before it crashed. De Mauro was convinced that he had got hold of a story of a lifetime. Before his disappearance he told colleagues at the newspaper L'Ora, \u201cI have a scoop that is going to shake Italy.\u201d\n\nDisappearance\n\nDe Mauro was kidnapped on the evening of 16 September 1970, while coming back home from work, in the via delle Magnolie in Palermo. In response, thousands of police and Carabinieri, equipped with helicopters and dogs, combed Sicily in vain in search of the reporter. De Mauro's body has never been found, a victim of the so-called lupara bianca, despite intensive search efforts assisted by top-level forces from Rome and even a special investigative committee of the Italian Parliament.\n\nOver the years, the investigations into De Mauro's disappearance by the Carabinieri and the police followed widely divergent leads. Colonel Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa and Captain Giuseppe Russo of the Carabinieri were among the first to work on the case. Years later, and in different circumstances, both were murdered by the Mafia. They focused on the lead of drug trafficking. According to them, De Mauro would have been a victim of lupara bianca after discovering leads on drug trafficking by the Mafia between Sicily and the U.S.\n\nThe first inquiries of the police by Bruno Contrada and Boris Giuliano instead focused on the lead of De Mauro's investigations into the death of Mattei, prompted by the disappearance a few pages of notes and a tape of Mattei's last speech from De Mauro's office. The investigations were seriously hampered due to deviations by people within the Italian police and secret services. According to police inspector Giuliano, there was \"someone at the ministry in Rome that does not want to go to the bottom of the death of De Mauro.\" According to Giuliano, an order to scale down the investigation was issued by the head of the secret service, Vito Miceli, allegedly involved in the Borghese coup. Miceli had been in contact with the mafiosi Di Cristina and Giuseppe Calderone, who wanted to support the coup, which was scheduled for December 1970.\n\nItalian mystery\n\nThe disappearance of De Mauro remained a mystery and the",

  "Mirrors (novel)\n\nMirrors (Al-Maraya) is Naguib Mahfouz\u2019s 1972 novel. In it, Mahfouz creates portraits of the characters. The novel does not parallel the traditional Arabic novel, for it focuses on the characters instead of the plot in an attempt to create artistic images of people who were actual contemporaries of Mahfouz. He does this by shedding the light on the secretive and known aspects of the characters\u2019 lives and closely connecting them to the plot and the plot's effect on their lives. Additionally, Mahfouz incorporates his own opinions on these characters and the political eras they lived through.\n\nSummary\n\nThe novel includes 55 characters. The reader initially thinks that they are all fictional; however, after closely reading they realize that they are all real characters stripped off their names and appearances. Most of these characters were contemporaries of Mahfouz. The 55 characters include: The professor, embodying the thinker who does not belong to any cause or anyone other than himself, the other character contradicts the first character in that it is the thinker who remains principled with time, no matter the hardships he faces. It also includes the thug who relies on violence, the nationalist who grieves over the failure of the delegation with the departure of Makram Ebeid and Al-Naqrashi from the party, the student who was martyred in Cairo's streets defending Egypt's 1923 constitution, which was discontinued by Isma\u02bfil \u1e62idqi, the imprudent woman who cheats on her husband with his friend, the woman searching for true love despite being in her 70s with a husband and kids, the revolutionary who's a member of the Free Officers Movement, the thinker who died fighting police officers whilst getting arrested, whose legend persists after his death, the sex-obsessed woman, the tough communist who only knows honesty and rigidness, the beautiful communist plastic artist, the trader who only trades in what is forbidden, and the pious religious character. The 55 characters make up an elaborate portrait, allowing the reader to form opinions on these characters, and the vast difference between each character aids in and increases the importance of forming these opinions.\n\nOn the novel\n\nMany critics believe that the importance of Mahfouz's \u201cMirrors\u201d lies in the way it presents and critiques the \u201cThinkers\u201d in Egypt, which was one of the most important social classes in Egypt during the 20th century. Also, Mahfouz's works, in general, and \u2018Mirrors,\u2019 in particular, led to the development of what is known as (\u2018Adab Al-Talsin) or (Gossip Literature), which is a term coined by the critic Faruq Abdelkadir to describe a literary style used by authors to settle personal matters with their enemies. Hence, \u2018Mirrors\u2019 is a clear example of this literary style.",

  "2004 Constitution of Afghanistan\n\nThe 2004 Constitution of Afghanistan was the supreme law of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, which lasted from 2004 - 2021. It served as the legal framework between the Afghan government and the Afghan citizens. Although Afghanistan (Afghan Empire) was made a state in 1747 by Ahmad Shah Durrani, the earliest Afghan constitutional movement began during the reign of Emir Abdur Rahman Khan in the 1890s followed by the drafting in 1922 of a constitution. The 1964 Constitution of Afghanistan transformed Afghanistan into a modern democracy.\n\nThe constitution was approved by the consensus in January 2004 after the 2003 loya jirga. The Constitution consists of 162 articles and was officially signed by Hamid Karzai on January 26, 2004. It evolved out of the Afghan Constitution Commission mandated by the Bonn Agreement. The constitution provides for an elected President and National Assembly. The transitional government of interim president Hamid Karzai was put in place after the June 2002 loya jirga. The first presidential elections after the new constitution was in effect, took place in October 2004, and Karzai was elected to a five-year term. The first elections for the National Assembly were delayed until September 2005. The constitution was essentially abolished on August 15, 2021 with the overthrow and dissolution of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan by the Taliban following the Fall of Kabul.\n\nEligibility of President\n\nArticle 62 of the Constitution of Afghanistan of 2004 states that a candidate for the office of President:\n\nLegislative branch\n\nThe National Assembly of Afghanistan consists of two houses: the Wolesi Jirga (House of the People) and the Meshrano Jirga (House of Elders).\n\nThe Wolesi Jirga, the more powerful house, consists of a maximum of 250 delegates directly elected through a system of single non transferable vote (SNTV). Members are elected on a provincial basis and serve for five years. At least 64 delegates must be women; and ten Kuchi nomads were also elected among their peers. The Wolesi Jirga has the primary responsibility for making and ratifying laws and approving the actions of the president and has considerable veto power over senior appointments and policies\n\nThe Meshrano Jirga will consist of an unspecified number of local dignitaries and experts appointed by provincial councils, district councils, and the president. The president also appoints two representatives of the physically disabled. The lower house passes laws, approve budgets and ratify treaties \u2013 all of which will require subsequent approval by the Meshrano Jirga.\n\nJudicial branch and court system\n\nThe nation's top court is the Stera Mahkama (Supreme Court). Its members are appointed by the president for 10-year terms. There are also High Courts, Appeals Courts, and local and district courts. Eligible judges can have training in either Islamic jurisprudence or secular law.\n\nCourts are allowed to use Hanafi jurisprudence in situations where the Constitution lacks provisions.\n\nCabinet\n\nThe current cabinet consists of the president, his two vice-presidents and 25 ministers. The ministers are appointed by the president but need approval from the Wolesi Jirga (lower house).\n\nProvinces and Districts\n\nThe constitution divides Afghanistan into 34 provinces. Each province is governed by a provincial council with members elected for four-year terms. Provincial Governors are appointed by the president. Provinces are divided into districts, which contain villages and towns. Every village and town will also have councils, with members serving for three years.\n\nReligion\n\nThe Constitution describes Islam as its sacred law and the most commonly practiced faith throughout Afghanistan.\n\nFollowers of other religions are \"free to exercise their faith and perform their religious rites\" within the limits of the law. There is no mention of freedom of thought, and apostasy from Islam.\n\nCivil and human rights\n\nCitizens are guaranteed the right to life and liberty, to privacy, of peaceful assembly, from torture and of expression and speech. If accused of a crime, citizens hold the right to be informed of the charges, to representation by an advocate, and to presumption of innocence. Article 34 states, \"Freedom of expression shall be inviolable. Every Afghan shall have the right to express thoughts through speech, writing, illustrations as well as other means in accordance with provisions of this constitution.  Every Afghan shall have the right, according to provisions of law, to print and publish on subjects without prior submission to state authorities.  Directives related to the press, radio and television as well as publications and other mass media shall be regulated by law.\"\n\nProvisions are made to ensure free education and healthcare for all citizens.\n\nLanguage\n\nArticle 16 of the constitution states that \"from amongst Pashto, Dari, Uzbek, Turkmen, Balochi, Pashai, Nuristani and other current languages in the country, Pashto and Dari shall be the official languages of the state.\" In addition, other languages are considered \"the third official language\" in areas where they are spoken by a majority.\n\nArticle 20 states that the Afghan National Anthem (Wolesi Tarana) \"shall be in Pashto with the mention of \"God is Great\" as well as the names of the tribes of Afghanistan.\"\n\nThe constitution aims \"to foster and develop all languages of Afghanistan.\" (Article 16)\n\nLand ownership\n\nForeigners are not allowed to own land in Afghanistan.

  "Girolamo Casanate\n\nGirolamo Casanate (historic spelling variations include Casanata and Casanatta) (13 February 1620 in Naples &ndash; 3 March 1700 in Rome) was an Italian Cardinal.\n\nBiography\n\nHis father, Tommaso Casanatta, was a member of the supreme council of the Kingdom of Naples. Girolamo studied law at the university of his native town and practised in the courts for some time. Eventually he gave up the promises of a secular career and entered the service of the Church, in deference to the advice of Cardinal Pamphili whom he had met on a visit to Rome. When that cardinal became pope as Innocent X, Casanate was made private chamberlain and soon advanced rapidly in the ecclesiastical career, becoming in turn Governor of Sabina, Fabriano, Ancona, and Camerino. In the last-named city he became a close friend of its bishop, Emilio Altieri, afterwards Pope Clement X. In 1658 Pope Alexander VII sent him as inquisitor to Malta, whence he was shortly recalled to Rome and made prelate of the Consulta and active member of the courts known as the Segnatura di Grazia and the Segnatura di Giustizia.\n\nHe was Consultor of the Congregation of Rites and of Propaganda, and governor of the conclave that chose the successor of Alexander VII; under Clement IX he was made assessor of the Holy Office (Congregation of the Inquisition). He was appointed secretary of the Congregation of Bishops and Regulars by Clement X, and 13 June 1673, was named Cardinal-Deacon of the Title of Santa Maria in Porticu, and later (1686) Cardinal-Priest of the Title of San Silvestro in Capite. In 1693 Innocent XII bestowed on him the office of Librarian of the Vatican (Bibliotecario di Santa Romana Chiesa).\n\nHe held many offices which required profound knowledge of numerous doctrinal, disciplinary, and political questions brought before the Holy See in the latter half of the seventeenth century. Among them controversies concerning Quietism (Miguel de Molinos, F\u00e9nelon, Madame Guyon); the Gallican Liberties including Louis XIV 1673 assertion of the right of R\u00e9gale and his Four Articles of 1682; and the Chinese Rites controversy between the Jesuits and the Dominicans and other orders.\n\nOn his death-bed he was assisted by two Dominicans, Father Antonin Cloche the general of the order, and Antoine Massouli\u00e9. He was buried in the Basilica of St. John Lateran, though his heart was deposited in Santa Maria sopra Minerva, the church of the Dominicans, to whom he was always warmly attached, and who looked on him as their benefactor.\n\nImmediately after Casanate's death, Cloche commissioned his tomb in the Lateran basilica from Pierre Le Gros the Younger, which was inaugurated in 1703.\n\nBiblioteca Casanatense\n\nCasanate's chief service to learning, especially theology, was the Biblioteca Casanatense, founded and endowed by him. During his life he had collected about 25,000 books which he left to Santa Maria sopra Minerva, together with an endowment of 80,000 scudi for administration and the acquisition of new books.\n\nHe also provided funds for a college (theologi casanatenses) of six Dominicans of different nationalities (Italian, French, Spanish, German, English, Polish) and two professors who would regularly lecture on texts by St. Thomas Aquinas, particularly the Summa Theologica.\n\nTo honour his friend, Cloche also had a statue of Cardinal Casanate made by Le Gros which, in 1708, was placed outside the old entrance to the library but shortly later moved into the enlarged reading room.\n\nCollege of St. Thomas\n\nTo foster the study of Greek, Hebrew and Dogmatic Theology, Casanate also endowed 4 chairs of learning at the College of St. Thomas (the future Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum) which was at the times also attached to Santa Maria sopra Minerva.",
  "Children's Crusade (Britten)\n\nChildren's Crusade, Op. 82, subtitled a Ballad for children's voices and orchestra is a composition by Benjamin Britten. He completed it in 1969, setting Bertolt Brecht's poem Kinderkreuzzug 1939 for children's choir with some solo parts, keyboard instruments and an array of percussion, to be performed mainly by children. It was first performed in an English version at St Paul's Cathedral in London on 19 May 1969.\n\nHistory\n\nBenjamin Britten composed several works for performance by children. He wrote Children's Crusade in October and November 1968, setting a narrative poem by Bertolt Brecht entitled Kinderkreuzzug 1939, translated by Hans Keller. The composer stated that he had been interested in setting the text for some time, and suggested it as appropriate when he was approached to compose a work for the 50th anniversary of the Save The Children Fund.\n\nChildren's Crusade was performed, in an English version, by members of the Wandsworth School Choir, conducted by Russell Burgess, at St Paul's Cathedral in London on 19 May 1969, as part of a commemorative service. The same year, the performance was repeated as part of the Proms, in a concert at the Royal Albert Hall on 31 August, with Mozart's Symphony No. 25 in G minor and Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 6 \"Pathetique\".\n\nIt was published by Faber Music in 1970, dedicated to Hans Werner Henze.\n\nThe first performers recorded the work in 1970 for a collection of Britten Rarities, with the Wandsworth School Boys' Choir, among the soloists Adrian Thompson, pianists Ian Cobb and John Clegg, organist Jonathan Smith and six percussionists. The first performance of the German version took place in Braunschweig in 1980 by girls and boys of the Braunschweiger Jugendchor (Brunswick Youth Choir), conducted by Manfred Ehrhorn, followed by the first recording in German a year later. It was reissued in 2012.\n\nIn 2002 and 2003, the work was recorded, with other music by Britten for children, by the Choristers of Christ Church Cathedral and Worcester College Chapel Choristers, Christian Wilson (piano), John Madden (percussion and chamber organ) and the Oxfordshire Youth Percussion Ensemble, conducted by Stephen Darlington. A 2015 recording by the M\u00e4dchenchor Hannover conducted by Gudrun Schr\u00f6fel combined the work with Britten's A Ceremony of Carols.\n\nTheme\n\nThe topic is a group of children in Poland during World War II in quest of peace. It was, after Britten's War Requiem, another work inspired by his pacifist convictions, pointing out the \"futility of war, witnessed through the eyes of a group of brave Polish children in the face of overwhelming odds\", based on Brecht's imagery.\n\nMusic\n\nBritten scored the vocal part for a boys' choir with nine solo parts. The orchestra includes a battery of percussion, two pianos and electronic organ or portable organ. The work takes about 19 minutes to perform. The percussion is intended to be played by children with the help of a few adults. The pianos and organ are designed to establish pitch. The work has been regarded as \"a bleak pacifist message\", and an \"utterly serious piece of music, cleverly designed so as to involve as many children as possible in conveying the rather desperate, bleak message of Brecht\u2019s poem\".",

  "National Archives of Japan\n\nThe Independent Administrative Institution National Archives of Japan (\u72ec\u7acb\u884c\u653f\u6cd5\u4eba\u56fd\u7acb\u516c\u6587\u66f8\u9928) preserve Japanese government documents and historical records and make them available to the public. Although Japan's reverence for its unique history and art is well documented and illustrated by collections of art and documents, there is almost no archivist tradition. Before the creation of the National Archives, there was a scarcity of available public documents which preserve \"grey-area\" records, such as internal sources to show a process which informs the formation of a specific policy or the proceedings of various committee meetings.\n\nIn accordance with the National Archives Law No.79 (1999), the core function of preserving \"government documents and records of importance as historical materials\" includes all material relating to (1) decision-making on important items of national policies, and (2) processes of deliberation, discussion, or consultation prior to reaching any decision-making, and the process of enforcing policies based on decisions made. The transfer of what are deemed historically important materials from the various ministries and agencies is carried out on a regular basis in accordance with the Transfer Plan prepared and revised by the Prime Minister for each fiscal year. Preservation, restoration cataloging, microfilming and digitization are all important aspects of the archive's responsibilities. However, the National Archives is in the process of becoming something more than simply a historical repository, because it is also a complex of structures, processes, and epistemologies which are situated at a critical point of the intersection between scholarship, cultural practices, politics, and technologies.\n\nHistory\n\nSince the Meiji Period (1868\u20131912), administrative documents had been preserved respectively by each government ministry. A library for the cabinet of the early Meiji government was established in 1873; and in 1885, this became the Cabinet Library (Naikaku Bunko), which evolved as the nation's leading specialized library of ancient Japanese and Chinese classical books and materials. The Cabinet Library's collection included government records of the Edo period and the Tokugawa shogunate (1603\u20131867) and other material. These collections are an important element of the archive's core holdings.\n\nIn November 1959, the President of the Science Council of Japan issued a recommendation establishing a National Archives to prevent scattering and loss of official documents and to facilitate public access. In July 1971, the newly created Archives began receiving, assessing, and cataloging government documents and records of importance as historical materials; and also, the Archives focused on the conceptually distinct program designed to encourage wider interest by mounting exhibitions and fostering research.\n\nIn July 1998, the Tsukuba Annex (Tsukuba Gakuen Toshiwas) was established in Ibaraki Prefecture in order to expand and improve the storage of archival materials.\n\nA Cabinet resolution in 1999 led to the creation of the Japan Center for Asian Historical Records (\u30a2\u30b8\u30a2\u6b74\u53f2\u8cc7\u6599\u30bb\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc), which opened in November 2001. The center digitizes data from various national institutions, such as the National Archives, Diplomatic Record Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Military Archives of the National Institute for Defense Studies of the Japan Defense Agency, and provides the digital data through the Internet.\n\nIndependent Administrative Institution\n\nThe National Archives became an Independent Administrative Institution on April 1, 2001, when an Act amending part of the National Archives Law came into effect. Archival responsibilities include managing public access to stored records, and overseeing the collection as it grows and develops and preservation protocols.\n\nThe enhanced independence of the archives was designed to help further its institutional focus on measures for the proper conservation of historical materials.\n\nOn-line access\n\nThe National Archives website provides information about the archives and catalog data which allow the holdings to be searched online. The site offers English and Japanese versions; the holdings themselves are, of course, mainly in Japanese. The website facilitates access to brief descriptions and some images of documents, books, and cultural properties. The Digital Gallery may be searched using keywords or various categories, opening access to digitised images of scrolls; maps; photographs; drawings; posters; and documents. English summaries of publications from the National Archives (journal and annual report) are available for downloading from the site.\n\nFrom April 2005, the digital archive system in this website has provided high-resolution pictures of a range of holdings, including the materials designated as Important Cultural Properties of Japan. The collections in the National Archives provide tangible evidence of memory for individuals, communities, and the state; and the archives are integral in a process of defining memory institutionally within Japan's prevailing political systems and cultural norms.\n\nThe National Archives has evolved as a model for developing prefectural and municipal archival collections\u2014some of which predate the establishment of the national institution. In these smaller institutions, similar activities of preservation, restoration, cataloging, microfilming and digitization are evolving. For example, the Digital Gallery includes digitized photos of the stack room for official documents in Shiga Prefecture in 1924. These images were appended to a report submitted by the prefectural governor to the chief of the cabinet secretariat in November of that year. Shiga's governor was describing the progress of work intended to modernize standards and procedures for compiling and storing of written records, which was expected to produce improved efficiencies in administrative services.",

He was also visiting Associate Professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1963-64 and Visiting Professor at the Universiti Sains Malaysia in Penang in 1976.\n\nHis first experience in Latin America was in Argentina at the Consejo Nacional de Desarrollo (Conade) in 1964-65 where he worked under the auspices of the Harvard Development Advisory Service (DAS). He teamed with British economist Geoffrey Maynard to develop a stabilization model which was applied by the following administration during the period 1967-1970. After initial success in reducing the inflation rate from 22 to 7 percent without causing a major recession, the stabilization effort broke down in 1970.\n\nHis next assignment was under the auspices of the so-called Berkeley-Group in Brazil at IPEA, where he constructed the country`s first input-output table for 1959. In addition, he formulated an exact method for determining the technology matrix in a situation with secondary products.\n\nIn 1972-73, he joined the University of Michigan team of economic advisors to the Planning Ministry of Morocco. This resulted in the publication of the collective book Employment Problems and Policies in Developing Countries-The Case of Morocco of which he was the editor in 1976.\n\nIn 1974, he was invited to become President of the Belgian Statistical Society. The same year, he published in the International Statistical Review a method for estimating measurement errors in national account statistics.\n\nIn 1976, he published together with Geoffrey Maynard A World of Inflation. In this book, they distanced themselves from the dominant monetarist thinking, and drew attention to structural factors in explaining differences in inflation rates between countries.

Later he gained a law degree from New York Law School.\n\nPhotography\n\nFink was self-taught in photography, using a 35 mm camera and a home-made darkroom in his small apartment on West 92nd street.\n\nHis first photographs date from 1954, of friends, holidays in Europe, and scenes in New York City. \"His photographs of gay life begin with groups of gay men photographed in Greenwich Village in 1967\" and he continued to focus on his own LGBT culture in New York City throughout the 1970s and 1980s. He photographed many of the annual Pride Marches beginning with the first in 1970\u2014the Christopher Street Liberation Day march; the West Village's gay bar culture, especially on West Street;  and in particular the abandoned West Side Hudson River piers, such as Christopher Street Pier. The rundown piers served as a space for gay men to interact and Fink photographed the cruising and sexual encounters, including his own. He made both candid photographs as well as those where his subjects knew they were being photographed. Elsewhere too, he often made self-portraits.\n\nFink neither published nor exhibited his photographs in his lifetime, sharing them only with close friends. At the time of his death he had over 5,000 prints and around 25,000 negatives.\n\nPersonal life\n\nLittle is known about him. Most of his working life was spent as a lawyer for the New York City Transit Authority, where he investigated and defended the city against accident claims. \"He lived frugally, spending much of his income on photographic supplies.\"\n\nFink was \"well known in the gay scene of the West Village of the early 1980s\" He \"was a colorful and ubiquitous character in the Village and at Pride parades, usually appearing on rollerskates in short cut-offs, and a tight t-shirt with cameras always around his neck. He sometimes arrived on a bicycle or a motorcycle.\"\n\nHe died of complications relating to AIDS.\n\nLegacy\n\nHis complete photographic archive, consisting of work from 1954 to 1992, is held in the archive of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender Community Center in New York City.",

  "Mind the Gap (song)\n\n\"Mind the Gap\" is a song by Danish singer Nabiha, released as the lead single from her second studio album of the same name. She wrote it with Michelle Escoffery, Carl Ryden and Will Simms. The name was inspired from warning signs on the London Underground station, while it also refers to the gap between her front teeth, meaning good luck. The song has been a hit on various charts in UK. Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Bulgaria, Poland and Hungary, and has also been positively received by music critics.\n\nBackground and composition\n\n\"Mind the Gap\" was written by Nabiha, Michelle Escoffery, Carl Ryden, and Will Simms, with both Ryden and Simms handling production of the song. The entire song was recorded, produced and mixed by Ryden at Make Music Studio in London, and was mastered at Metroplis in London. The track was released as the lead single of her second studio album of the same name, where it is the third track, on 10 September 2012.\n\n\"Mind the Gap\" is a funky soul pop song that plays for a duration of 2 minutes and 46 seconds. Instrumentation includes lead vocals, backing vocals, keyboards, guitar, and programmed drums. The backing vocalist for the song was Terri Walker. The title and concept of the song came from seeing warnings at the London Underground station on numerous trips to the studio, which read \"Mind the Gap\". It also comes from the space between her front teeth, and her experience with other people looking at her. According to Nabiha, \"It is a huge part of me, and in many African countries it symbolizes \u2018good luck\u2019. So the message is that we must take care of each other and ourselves, so everybody arrives safely to their destination.\"\n\nCritical reception\n\nGaffa wrote that \"Mind the Gap\", along with \"Kill It With Love\" and \"Heartbreaker\", were \"excellent numbers which funnily enough is the most efficient on the album [Mind the Gap].\" Scandipop considered the song her best one throughout her career, writing \"Instantly catchy, it\u2019s the sort of one-listen-and-you\u2019re-hooked kind of thing that we subscribe to so heavily around these parts. \u201cmind the gap, mind the girl, da-da-da-da-da-da-daaaa\u201d (not the actual lyrics).\" Ekstra Bladet opined that \"'Mind the Gap' refers to Nabiha space between the front teeth, but the title would therefore seem more cheerful if she also had glorious characteristics musically.\"\n\nMusic video\n\nThe video for \"Mind the Gap\" premiered on 26 November 2012. It was directed by Scott Altman. The video is in black-and-white, with Nabiha performing in front of the microphone. According to Altman, \"After pitching on the video, label and management approached me with a couple of ideas. In the end we stripped the ideas back and decided to shoot a performance based video in black and white. Once again Nabiha was great to work with \u2013 a natural performer, whose ability and talent got better with every take.\"\n\nLive performances\n\n\"Mind the Gap\" has been performed by Nabiha at the 2012 Danish Music Awards, and on 18 April 2013 at the Store Vega. The song will be performed during the album's 2013 autumn tour.\n\nIn other media\n\nFinnish producer Lenno did a 70's disco remix of \"Mind the Gap\", which included instruments of horns, pianos, and strings.\n\n\"Mind the Gap\" was played on the ninth episode of Pretty Little Liars' fourth season, titled \"Into the Deep.\"\n\nPersonnel\n\nAdapted from liner notes of Mind the Gap:",

  "Richard Saunders (skeptic)\n\nRichard Saunders is an Australian skeptic, podcaster, and professional origamist. He received recognition by the Australian Skeptics with a Life Membership in 2001, and has twice served as their president. He founded Sydney Skeptics in the Pub. He has presented on skepticism, represented the Australian Skeptics on television and radio shows, and is the co-host of The Skeptic Zone podcast.\n\nEarly life\n\nSaunders was born in Kurri Kurri, New South Wales, Australia, and lived in Tribune, Saskatchewan in 1968 and 1969, as his father R. H. Saunders, who was a reverend, was posted there. Returning to Australia, Saunders attended a variety of primary schools in Mullumbimby, Lithgow, and graduated from Woy Woy High School in 1984.\n\nWeb design\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Saunders joined educational publisher Ashton Scholastic and sold educational software for Apple II and Commodore 64 home computers. He also worked as a web designer for The Advance Bank of Australia and Commonwealth Bank and in 1999 was transferred to EDS, where he designed the interface for netBank online banking and worked for two years before joining GreenStone Pty Ltd as a web designer for three years.\n\nActing\n\nSaunders works as a part-time actor and a film and TV extra, appearing in the background in such feature films as Superman Returns and Australia as well as in the background in the TV shows All Saints and Home and Away.\n\nIn 2013 he was invited to be a member of the \"World Competition Jury\" at Academia Film Olomouc's 48th International Festival of Science Documentary Films or AFO48 in the Czech Republic. He also gave a lecture on the claims of water divining as part of the \"Pseudoscience\" block and a lecture and workshops on origami as part of the \"Beauty of Numbers\" block.\n\nOrigami\n\nIn 1988 Saunders began authoring over twenty books on origami, which subsequently were featured on the Australian children's television program Wombat, The Afternoon Show, and similar programs.\n\nIn 2008 Saunders and Gary Clark produced DVD Origami, an instructional DVD with step-by-step instructions on how to fold 20 paper models.\n\nSaunders has used his skills in origami to design an origami Pigasus in honour of the mascot of the James Randi Educational Foundation. He authored instructions for folding the Pigasus and a dragon for Skeptic magazine. He also recorded a YouTube instructional video of the Pigasus.\n\nProfessional skeptic\n\nSaunders has over 10 years of experience researching claims of the paranormal. As a teenager he was inspired by Channel 7's Great Mysteries of the World with Scott Lambert; he was surprised at just how easily people could fool themselves, even after being shown evidence that they may be wrong. A TV documentary called James Randi in Australia was another great skeptical influence on Saunders. He joined the committee of the Australian Skeptics in 2001 and has been president and vice president of the organization. He was granted a Life Membership in the organization in recognition of his work on The Great Skeptic CD. He went on to create the Great Water Divining DVD and the \"card carrying skeptic card\". He founded Sydney Skeptics in the Pub, initiated The Skeptic Tank radio show on Net.FM with Stefan Sojka, produced The Australian Skeptics collection on \"Theories of Everything\" for TVS local Sydney TV, and created several of the Australians Skeptics convention DVDs. He was the acting artistic director and layout manager for The Skeptic Magazine from Australian Skeptics until Tim Mendham was appointed the new editor in June 2009.\n\nIn 2003 Saunders co-founded Mystery Investigators with Alynda Brown and Ian Bryce. The program teaches students to use science and critical thinking to investigate claims of the paranormal, such as water divining, spoon bending, and firewalking. In 2008 Brown left the show and was replaced by biologist Rachael Dunlop. In 2013 the show celebrated 10 years of performing.\n\nIn 2010 he helped organize the first The Amaz!ng Meeting Australia in Sydney. The meeting featured presentations by several high-profile members of the skeptical community, including James Randi, Brian Dunning, and Eugenie Scott.\n\nPublic & media appearances\n\nSaunders has made many appearances on radio and television in his role as a skeptic, including on Today Tonight,  Sunrise, Radio 2GB, Radio 2UE,  Nova 106.9, 702 ABC, and the pilot show for Curiosity Aroused. In 2007 he did a recurring segment for the Mike Williams Saturday Night Live radio program called Myths and Mysteries. In 2011 and 2012 he was a regular on The Dirty Disbelievers, a radio program on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio network.\n\nIn July and August 2008 (series #1) and in 2011 (series #2), Saunders appeared as the resident skeptic judge on The One, an Australian reality television program on the Seven Network that tested the powers of several alleged psychics.\n\nSaunders has spoken at many skeptic meetings including the Australian Skeptics National Convention in 2003, 2004, and 2008. In the United States he appeared at The Amaz!ng Adventure North to Alaska in 2007, and The Amaz!ng Meeting 6  and the Skeptrack at Dragon*Con, both in 2008.\n\nSaunders produced the Vaccination Chronicles in 2014. The film is a 30-minute documentary collects first-hand anecdotes about the horrors faced by parents of recent generations, when many saw their children die from diseases which are now preventable with vaccines.\n\nPodcasting\n\nSaunders was producer and host of The Tank Vodcast (aka The Skeptic Tank). In 2008 this podcast became The Skeptic Zone podcast, which released its 500th episode on 19 May 2018. It is produced weekly and is billed as \"The Podcast from Australia for Science and Reason\". Saunders has produced every episode of The Skeptic Zone podcast.\n\nSaunders has also appeared as a guest on many other podcasts and vodcasts including The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe, Skepticality, Dragon*Pod,   The Reason Driven Podcast, The Amateur Scientist Podcast, Bad Psychics TV, and Meet The Skeptics!.\n\nGreat Australian Psychic Prediction Project\n\nIn 2020 Saunders assembled an international team of skeptics to help him complete a project he had been working on since at least 2018, dubbed the \"Great Australian Psychic Prediction Project\". In addition to Saunders, the team includes Adrienne Hill, Michelle Bijkersma, Rob Palmer, Leonard Tramiel, Paula Lauterbach, Louis Hillman, Wendy Hughes, Angie Mattke, Kelly Burke and Susan Gerbic. As of March 21, 2021, the project encompassed 3224 predictions, with approximately 650 yet to be evaluated.\n\nThe project's goal is to collect and determine the accuracy of every psychic prediction published in Australia since 2000. Predictions primarily concern Australia, and the topics include politics, scandals, celebrities, natural disasters, real estate trends, sports, and weather patterns. A minority of predictions concern events outside of Australia. Saunders said that the project \"has the opportunity to show us that there are indeed some people who can peer into the future\". However, reporting on the interim results for one category, horse racing, Saunders reported that \"the overall results are not great for those who claim to see into the future and from what we have gathered so far, I wouldn\u2019t be placing any bets based on their mystical advice.\"\n\nAdrienne Hill also reflected on the absence of any prediction concerning the historic event that transpired on January 6, the 2021 storming of the United States Capitol, which the team watched unfold. She wrote, \"Isn\u2019t it amazing that this event is nowhere to be found in the ponderings of those who claim to be able to predict the future?\"\n\nApart from Psychics being wrong, it is interesting how many major events were not predicted. These include 9/11 and the COVID-19 Pandemic.",

About 9.0% of families and 12.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 15.7% of those under age 18 and 14.0% of those age 65 or over.\n\nHurricane Irene 2011\n\nOn August 27, 2011, Hurricane Irene (at that point, a tropical storm) inflicted damage to the town. Very heavy rainfall caused the Schoharie Creek to surge higher and cause immense widespread flooding. High wind speeds were also present. A small bridge was destroyed, and numerous houses were also washed away by the creek. Farms near the creek were flooded as well. Flash flooding also was an issue. Certain roads that run through the town were flooded and some were damaged. Many homes in Lexington lost power.\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency arrived in Lexington following the storm. People volunteered for cleanup work and many donated food and clothing. Power was eventually restored to all affected areas.",

  "Gas cluster ion beam\n\nGas cluster ion beams (GCIB) is a technology for nano-scale modification of surfaces. It can smooth a wide variety of surface material types to within an angstrom of roughness without subsurface damage. It is also used to chemically alter surfaces through infusion or deposition.\n\nProcess\n\nUsing GCIB a surface is bombarded by a beam of high-energy, nanoscale cluster ions. The clusters are formed when a high pressure gas (approximately 10 atmospheres pressure) expands into a vacuum (1e-5 atmospheres). The gas expands adiabatically and cools then condenses into clusters. The clusters are nano-sized bits of crystalline matter with unique properties that are intermediate between the realms of atomic physics and those of solid state physics. The expansion takes place inside of a nozzle that shapes the gas flow and facilitates the formation of a jet of clusters. The jet of clusters passes through differential pumping apertures into a region of high vacuum (1e-8 atmospheres) where the clusters are ionized by collisions with energetic electrons. The ionized clusters are accelerated electrostatically to very high velocities, and they are focused into a tight beam.\n\nThe GCIB beam is then used to treat a surface \u2014 typically the treated substrate is mechanically scanned in the beam to allow uniform irradiation of the surface. Argon is a commonly used gas in GCIB treatments because it is chemically inert and inexpensive. Argon forms clusters readily, the atoms in the cluster are bound together with Van der Waals forces. Typical parameters for a high-energy, Argon GCIB are acceleration voltage 30 kV, average cluster size 10,400 atoms, average cluster charge +3.2, average cluster energy 64 keV, average cluster velocity 6.5 km/s, with a total electrical current of 200 \u00b5A or more. When an Argon cluster with these parameters strikes a surface, a shallow crater is formed with a diameter of approximately 20 nm and a depth of 10 nm. When imaged using atomic force microscope (AFM) the craters have an appearance much like craters on planetary bodies. A typical GCIB surface treatment allows every point on the surface to be struck by many cluster ions, resulting in smoothing of surface irregularities.\n\nLower energy GCIB treatments can be used to further smooth the surface, and GCIB can be used to produce an atomic level smoothness on both planar and nonplanar surfaces. Almost any gas can be used for GCIB, and there are many more uses for chemically reactive clusters such as for doping semiconductors (using B2H6 gas), cleaning and etching (using NF3 gas), and for depositing chemical layers.\n\nIndustrial applications\n\nIn industry, GCIB has been used for the manufacture of semiconductor devices, optical thin films, trimming SAW and FBAR filter devices, fixed disk memory systems and for other uses. GCIB smoothing of high voltage electrodes has been shown to reduce field electron emission and GCIB treated RF cavities are being studied for use in future high energy particle accelerators.\n\nSmall argon cluster GCIB sources are increasingly used for analytical depth-profiling by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Argon clusters greatly reduce the damage introduced to the specimen during depth-profiling, making it practical to do so for many organic and polymeric materials for the first time. This has greatly extended the range of materials to which XPS (for example) can be applied. Gas cluster sputter rates of different polymers differ a great deal, and X-ray damage (of the type that accumulates during XPS analysis) can change these sputter rates markedly. While generally less damaging than monotomic sputtering, gas cluster ion sputtering can nevertheless introduce damage that is very noticeable in some materials.\n\nA related technique, with a limited range of applications, using high-velocity carbon Fullerenes to treat surfaces, has been studied.\n\nAccelerated neutral atoms beams (ANAB) is a recent variation on GCIB. With ANAB, the high velocity clusters are heated and evaporated by collisions with thermal energy gas molecules and the charged cluster remnants are deflected out of the beam leaving an intense focused beam of individual fast neutral monomers/atoms. The monomers are evaporated from the clusters with low thermal energies and they retain the center of mass velocity of the cluster and hence do not move out of the beam before colliding with the surface. When used to treat a surface, an ANAB beam has nearly the same total energy and velocity of the original GCIB beam but the smoothing effect on the surface is much different as the dispersed impacts of the individual fast atoms is more gentle than that of the clusters. With ANAB there is even less subsurface damage than with GCIB. The lack of electrical charge eliminates space-charge defocusing of the beam and static charge buildup on surfaces which is very useful for applications such as semiconductor device manufacturing.",

  "283rd Engineer Detachment (Terrain Analysis)\n\nThe 283d Engineer Detachment (Terrain Analysis) was a combat engineer detachment assigned to the 20th Engineer Brigade of the United States Army stationed at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Although the members of the unit wore blue airborne tabs as part of the brigade's shoulder patch, jump status was optional but encouraged.\n\nThe detachment, commanded by a field grade officer, consisted of approximately 10\u201312 personnel, half of which were company grade officers. The executive officer was a captain. Military occupational specialties (MOS) of the enlisted personnel included soils analysts, cartographic drafters, terrain analysts and clerk typists. At a minimum unit members held secret security clearance with officers and some non-commissioned officers holding Top Secret clearances. The detachment had a former Army Security Agency cartographic specialist with Top Secret security credentials in crypt o-analysis, special intelligence and NATO access assigned at one time.\n\nThe primary mission of the 283d was to provide land analysis for worldwide missions of the XVIII Airborne Corps. It was primarily sequestered away from the brigade area and its members were required not to discuss its work outside of its secure location.\n\nThe detachment was so small that it was part of a provisional battalion of the 20th Engineer Brigade and relied on its sister unit, the 63d Engineer Company, for its logistical support. 283d members were exempt from inspections, formal physical training routines, morning formations and the common extra duties required of other brigade members. Because of the nature of its work and close personal contact among its members the distinctions between officers and enlisted members were more relaxed than typical units but still maintained high 'esprit de corps' and discipline. By 1977 the brigade newspaper, 'The Level Line', noted that the 283d had no record of AWOL members. 'The Level Line' name was one of numerous suggestions submitted by 283rd personnel, 2LT Szigeti and SP5 Leviner et al., and was adopted for the newspaper by brigade. The unit adopted the mascot of the wasp by mid-1978. Additionally, from 1978\u20131981, the unit recorded 100% accuracy on SIDPERS transactions, achieved by SSG W.E. Truxon, and to date, has never been achieved during a 36-month period in any other military unit.",

  "Cretaceogekko\n\nCretaceogekko (meaning \u201cCretaceous gecko\u201d) is an extinct monotypic genus of gecko (represented by the type species Cretaceogekko burmae) known from a single partial specimen preserved in Burmese amber from the Cenomanian of Myanmar. The specimen was found in the Hukawng Valley in 2001 and the genus and species were named by E. Nicholas Arnold and George Poinar in 2008. The specimen includes a foot and partial tail. Cretaceogekko is the oldest known gecko, predating the Late Cretaceous gecko Gobekko and the Paleogene gecko Yanatarogecko, which has also been preserved in amber.\n\nThe preserved foot shows that Cretaceogekko already possessed the tiny lamellae or ridges on the toe pads that allow modern geckos to cling to vertical surfaces. Cretaceogekko had a striped skin pattern that probably served as camouflage.",

  "Vuia 1\n\nThe Vuia 1, also nicknamed Liliacul (the bat), was a pioneer aircraft designed and built by Romanian inventor Traian Vuia. It was finished in December 1905 in France and first flew on 18 March 1906 at Montesson.\n\nBackground\n\nAfter finishing his studies, Traian Vuia continued to study the problem of flying, and began building his first aircraft, which he called the Aeroplan Automobil. Being short of funds, Vuia left for Paris in June 1902, hoping he could find someone interested in funding his project.\n\nOnce there, Vuia met Georges Besan\u00e7on, the founder of the aeronautical journal L'A\u00e9rophile. With his help, Vuia managed to go through the vast documentation and fundamental works regarding aeronautics. Using the knowledge from other aviation pioneers such as George Cayley, Cl\u00e9ment Ader, Samuel Langley and Otto Lilienthal, he presented a document to the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences on 16 February 1903. However, his project was rejected with the response that \"The problem of flight with a machine which weighs more than air can not be solved and it is only a dream.\"\n\nRefusing to give up, he applied for a French patent on 15 May 1903. The patent (No. 332106) was issued on 17 August and published on 16 October, the same year.\n\nConstruction and design\n\nNot being able to find an engine for his airplane, he visited Victor Tatin, then addressed automobile manufactures Cl\u00e9ment-Bayard and Buchet, the latter of which provided the engine for the Santos-Dumont number 6 airship. Neither being able to help him with the engine, Vuia asked for help from Gheorghe Dobrin and together with other members of the Romanian community in Paris like Coriolan Brediceanu and Marius Sturza, enough funds were gathered for the engine.\n\nInitially, he managed to find an engine at Courbevoie, however its manufacturer was insolvent and Vuia lost the money. Inspired by this engine, Vuia designed an engine which was powered by liquid carbon dioxide. He submitted the patent on 14 November 1904, receiving it on 30 May 1905 (No. 349493). With a recommendation from Besan\u00e7on, Vuia got into contact with an automobile mechanic, Hockenjos, and construction of the aircraft started at the Hockenjos & Schmitt workshops. After initial construction of the aircraft was completed in February 1905, Vuia continued talks with Victor Tatin, who agreed to manufacture the propeller.\n\nIn August of the same year, Vuia bought a Serpollet engine which he modified after his design. The aircraft was finished in December 1905, with Ernest Archdeacon, Alberto Santos-Dumont and Victor Tatin being present during the mounting of the engine.\n\nDesign\n\nThe Vuia 1 was a parasol monoplane, its wings being attached to the upper part of a mobile metal frame which, together with the fixed lower chassis, made up the skeleton of the machine. The two wings could be folded and made up like an umbrella so that the plane could travel on the ground and be parked. The upper frame carried the engine, the airscrew and the rudder. The lower chassis had four wheels with pneumatic tires, the front wheels having shock-absorbing springs.\n\nOn the lower chassis the following components of the engine were mounted: the generator (a boiler which vaporized the carbonic acid gas), the acid gas tank, the kerosene tank (the burning of which was giving the necessary vaporizing temperature), the rudder and engine control devices, as well as the pilot seat. The link between the lower chassis and the upper frame was ensured by a set of four steel tubes, starting above each wheel and joined in a tip end, forming two triangles on each side. Between the tips of these triangles a steel tube, which in a horizontal plane was perpendicular to the flight path, supported the upper frame and the wings. This way the transversal tube became an axis around which the system formed by the upper frame and the wings was oscillating, allowing the variation of the angle of incidence while in flight, thus playing the role of an elevator. Hence, Traian Vuia was the first in the world to build wings with variable incidence during flight, an idea taken up later by other aircraft constructors.\n\nFlights\n\nAfter the aircraft was finished in December 1905, Vuia first tested it on the ground, going with 40 km/h without using the full power of the engine. In February 1906, Vuia made the first test of the aircraft without the wings on a road at Montesson. The test was watched by Georges Besan\u00e7on, duke and viscount Decazes, Gustave Hermite, Albert de Masfrand, journalists and photographers. The news of his aircraft was published the next day in France and Britain.\n\nOn 6 March, it was decided the mount the wings. On 18 March 1906, at 3.05 p.m., while in the presence of Hockenjos, Tiefenbacher, Watelet and mechanic Lallemand, the Vuia 1 lifted off the ground and flew at a height of about 1 m for about 12 m before the engine stopped. The aircraft, moved by the wind, hit a tree while coming down, damaging its wing and propeller.\n\nOn 6 May, Vuia flew again, however this flight was interrupted when a wing mount detached and damaged the canvas. The wing was quickly fixed with a white patch being added over the damaged part. Following this flight, Vuia would start looking for a new place to carry out his tests, obtaining the approval to use the military field at Issy-les-Moulineaux only on Sundays.\n\nThe first flight on the new field took place on 24 June, during which several short hops were achieved. On 1 July several more, longer hops, were achieved. Following this attempt, Vuia brought new modifications to his machine, which would be named Vuia 1-bis.\n\nVuia 1-bis\n\nAfter some successive changes, Vuia completed the upgrades in August. The wings of this machine had a smaller wing camber and an orientable stabilizer, improving the aerodynamic qualities of the plane. The angle of incidence was no longer adjusted in flight, being fixed before takeoff. The efficiency of the engine was also improved by increasing the airscrew's speed to 930 turns per minute. During the experiments the weight of the machine was changed several times. Initially planned to have 240 kg, the weight of the machine eventually reached 275 kg.\n\nOn 19 August a longer hop of 24 m at a height of about 2.5 m was made, ending in a heavy landing which damaged the propeller. Following this test, the other aviation pioneers started to pay more attention to Vuia's flights, and will resort to Vuia's solution of launching their machines directly on wheels.\n\nThe flight tests on 7 and 14 October were the first with an official presence. The control of the results being carried out by Ernest Archdeacon and \u00c9douard Surcouf. An accident, however, would put a stop to other tests in 1906, with Vuia also being unable to enroll in the A\u00e9ro-Club de France and participate in Archdeacon's Grand Prix due to monetary problems.\n\nVuia would carry out more tests on his Vuia 1-bis until 30 March 1907. However these were not more successful than the previous ones, Vuia giving up on the carbon dioxide engine and instead building an aircraft powered by a 25 hp Antoinette engine, the Vuia 2.\n\nLegacy\n\nVuia's tests were followed with attention by other aviation pioneers such as Ernest Archdeacon, Louis Bl\u00e9riot, Gabriel Voisin, Ferdinand Ferber and Alberto Santos-Dumont. According to Charles Dollfus, former curator of the Air Museum in Paris, Santos-Dumont's use of wheels on his aircraft was influenced by seeing Vuia's flight attempts.\n\nIn 2006, a working replica of Vuia's airplane was built to celebrate 100 years since his first flight. The replica was built by the Timi\u0219oara Academic Cultural Foundation (FACT) and was powered by a 25 hp Rotax engine. It was on display for a few days in Timi\u0219oara, then it was displayed at Montesson then taken on a tour through several European cities. The airplane was presented with its engine running without any flight attempts.",

  "Leprosy in China\n\nLeprosy was said to be first recognized in the ancient civilizations of China, Egypt and India, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease, was officially eliminated at the national level in China by 1982, meaning prevalence is lower than 1 in 100,000. There are 3,510 active cases today. Though leprosy has been brought under control in general, the situation in some areas is worsening, according to China's Ministry of Health. In the past, leprosy sufferers were ostracized by their communities as the disease was incurable, disfiguring and wrongly thought to be highly infectious.\n\nNumbers\n\n500,000 cases of leprosy were registered in China between 1950 and 2002. Most of these sufferers have been cured but approximately 6,000 active cases remain today and about 2,000 new cases are detected and registered every year. Many more cases are not registered, partly through ignorance, but also because of the stigma associated with the disease. The number of cases reported has varied over time, with the number of cases declining between 1985 and 1993 but staying flat between 1994 and 2001.\n\nThere are estimates that show that there are 200,000 people in China today who have recovered from the disease but more than half (110,000) are disabled due to the disease, with conditions ranging from blindness to disfigurement. Although these former leprosy sufferers were cured in the last 50 years, many of them still suffer serious pain and difficulties because of these disabilities/deformities and the stigma. This social stigma has become the main problem in leprosy diagnosis and treatment, today.\n\nAreas affected\n\nMostly, cases of infection remain in impoverished parts in the southwestern provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou and Sichuan, and Tibet in the west and Hunan in the South. Other provinces/municipalities affected on a smaller scale, are Anhui, Qinghai, Chongqing, Guangdong and Shaanxi.\n\nTransmission and pathology\n\nContrary to popular belief, leprosy ranks lowly in terms of infectiousness and is not congenital. It is passed via respiratory droplets among people in close and prolonged contact. The transmission rate is low and 95 percent of people are naturally immune to it. Caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae, leprosy affects the skin, mucous membranes, peripheral nerves and eyes. As nerve damage is permanent, even those who have recovered can not feel pain. Minor cuts and abrasions on fingers and toes often turn into gaping, inflamed ulcers because of unsanitary living conditions. These open sores overrun the digits, which slowly shrink and many sufferers end up with stumps. Some have legs amputated.\n\nTreatment\n\nIn China, dapsone was used from 1946 to treat leprosy, but treatment of the disease took a leap in 1982 with the introduction of a largely successful multidrug therapy (MDT) using dapsone, rifampicin and clofazimine. Today, therapy takes six months to a year. MDT treatment has been made available by the WHO free of charge to all patients worldwide since 1995, and provides a simple yet highly effective cure for all types of leprosy. If diagnosed and treated early, the disease leaves no traces. But in some places in China, stigma still surrounds the disease and victims do not seek treatment until it is too late.\n\nStigma\n\nIn current day China, leprosy is strongly associated with poverty and stigma remains a significant barrier to effective treatment.",
  "Jean de Gisors\n\nJean de Gisors (1133\u20131220) was a Norman lord of the fortress of Gisors in Normandy, where meetings were traditionally convened between English and French kings. It was here, in 1188, a squabble occurred that involved the cutting of an elm.\n\nInitially he was a vassal of the king of England - Henry II and then Richard I. During this time he also owned property in Sussex and the manor of Titchfield in Hampshire in England.\n\nSome time between 1170 and 1180 he purchased the manor of Buckland, Hampshire from the de Port family. On this newly purchased land he founded the town of Portsmouth as one end of a trade route between England and France. The original settlement of Portsmouth was a planned town on a medieval grid pattern, of which other examples can be found in places like Salisbury. Much of this original grid pattern is still visible in the Old Portsmouth district of Portsmouth.\n\nOne of the first acts ordered by de Gisors in Portsmouth was the donation of land to the Augustinian canons of Southwick Priory so that they could build a chapel \"to the glorious honour of the martyr Thomas of Canterbury, one time Archbishop, on (my) land which is called Sudewede, the island of Portsea\", Thomas Becket having spent much time in Gisors. This foundation of the Church of St Thomas of Canterbury was to eventually become Portsmouth Cathedral.\n\nHowever the royal patronage of de Gisors was not to last, as after his support for an unsuccessful rebellion in Normandy in 1193 he paid the price by forfeiting all his lands, including Portsmouth, to Richard I.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nIn conspiracy theories, such as the one promoted in The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, Jean de Gisors has been alleged to be the first Grand Master of the Priory of Sion (1188\u20131220).",

  "Cayetano Alberto Silva\n\nCayetano Alberto Silva (August 7, 1868 \u2014 January 12, 1920) was an Uruguayan musician, naturalized Argentine, and author; his work includes the San Lorenzo march, the official march of the Argentine army.\n\nEarly life\n\nSilva was born on August 17, 1868, in the department of Maldonado in San Carlos, Uruguay. His mother was Natalia Silva, a black slave of the family who gave her the surname. Cayetano Silva studied with Francisco Rinaldi of the Popular Band of San Carlos. In 1879, he attended the School of Arts and Crafts of Montevideo, where he joined its music band directed by Gerardo Grasso, who taught him music theory, horn, and violin. In 1888, he left the school to attend social centers of workers' agitation, theaters, and music conservatories in Montevideo.\n\nIn 1889, he traveled to Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he ventured to the Teatro Col\u00f3n and attended the School of Music directed by Pablo Berutti. He later moved to the city of Rosario, Province of Santa Fe; on February 1, 1894, he was appointed director of the Seventh Infantry Regiment band. In Rosario, he married Filomena Santanelli, with whom he raised eight children.\n\nSilva and his family moved to Venado Tuerto in 1898 after being hired by the Italian Society of Venado Tuerto. He founded a lyrical center, taught music, and created a rondalla\u2014an ensemble of plucked string instruments\u2014with which he performed during the Carnival of 1900. He wrote the music for the plays Canillita and Cedulas de San Juan for his compatriot friend Florencio S\u00e1nchez; both works were premiered in Rosario.\n\nLa Marcha San Lorenzo\n\nOn July 8, 1901, at his home in Venado Tuerto, he composed a march dedicated to Colonel Pablo Ricchieri, then war minister of that country and modernizer of the Argentine army. Ricchieri thanked him for the homage, but requested the title be changed to San Lorenzo, the city where Riccheri was born. The march was publicly performed for the first time on October 30, 1902, in San Lorenzo, in the vicinity of the historic San Carlos Convent, where the Battle of San Lorenzo took place. That day, the march was designated the official march of the Argentine Army. Two days after, Silva played it again at the opening ceremony for the monument to General San Mart\u00edn in Plaza San Mart\u00edn (Rosario), in the presence of President Julio Argentino Roca and Ricchieri.\n\nIn 1906, Silva became master of the Third Infantry Regiment. His neighbor, Carlos Javier Benielli, added the lyrics in 1907 that would later be adapted for schools. Years later, affected by poverty, Cayetano Silva sold the rights to the march to an editor in Buenos Aires for a negligible amount.\n\nThe march became famous in other countries over time to such an extent that it was played on June 22, 1911, during the coronations of King George V and Elizabeth II (with prior approval sought by the British government from Argentina). In addition, the march is played during the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace, although it was suspended during the Falklands War. It was also played by the Germans when they entered Paris during World War II. General Dwight D. Eisenhower also had it played during the entrance of the Allied army following the liberation of Paris.\n\nWhile residing in Mendoza, he founded the Firefighters Music Band of that city and worked as an educator.\n\nOther works\n\nOther marches composed by Cayetano Silva were: Black River, Anglo Boers, July 22, San Genaro (in honor of the city of the same name near Rosario), Curapayt\u00ed (1906, inspired by the Paraguayan War), and Tuyut\u00ed. Like the San Lorenzo March, the lyrics of the latter two were also written by Benielli.\n\nFinal years\n\nSilva was also a police employee in Rosario. In 1920, after dying of serious health problems in that city, he was denied burial in the Police Pantheon because he was black, and was buried in a grave without a name. In 1997, however, his remains were transferred to the municipal cemetery of Venado Tuerto, through efforts made by the association Friends of the Historical House \"Cayetano A. Silva\". This house\u2014headquarters of the regional museum, historical archives, and headquarters of the Cayetano A.

  "WTVML\n\nWTVML is an XML-based and WML-derived content format designed to allow web site operators to easily develop and deploy Interactive TV services, typically it reduces the time taken for web site operators to create a TV Site, and results in the Site being deployable on a larger number of devices, and is capable of being automatically validated, tested and transformed.\n\nWTVML was originally developed by Ian Valentine and Patrick Sansom in a company called WapTV. After demonstrating the ability to develop Interactive TV services using web infrastructures and XML, and successfully deploying them to existing TV set-top-boxes over dial up modems, the company was acquired by BSkyB. The technology was first used to launch Sky's interactive betting service on December 6th 2000, and later became the basis of a large number of \"red button\" channel portals and internet based interactive services.\n\nThe format follows a strict XML syntax (DTD) that has been developed in response to multiple user requirements by BSkyB, and is now being enhanced by Miniweb Interactive. The format was standardized through ETSI as TS 102 322.\n\nWTVML has the potential to unify the Interactive TV content creation industry, which has been hampered by proprietary \"middlewares\" and a lack of browser standards.\n\nThe fragmentation of technologies available to build Digital TV platforms has meant that typical web site operators have had no common content format available to them to allow them to develop their TV Site once, and deploy it unchanged across multiple networks and devices.\n\nSome newer set-top boxes (particularly IPTV devices) use various versions of HTML browsers. Many of these have proprietary TV extensions, and different deployment characteristics, which result in untested services being deployed unfaithfully or worse with run-time errors.

  "Putra of Perlis\n\nTuanku Syed Harun Putra ibni Almarhum Syed Hassan Jamalullail (Jawi: \u062a\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0643\u0648 \u0633\u064a\u062f \u0647\u0627\u0631\u0648\u0646 \u06a4\u0648\u062a\u0631\u0627 \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u062d\u0648\u0645 \u0633\u064a\u062f \u062d\u0633\u0646 \u062c\u0645\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u064a\u0644; 25 November 1920 \u2013 16 April 2000) was the third Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaya, and later of Malaysia and sixth Raja of Perlis.\n\nEarly career\n\nHe was the son of Syed Hassan bin Syed Mahmud Jamalullail (1897&ndash;18 October 1935), sometime Bakal Raja or heir presumptive to the throne of Perlis, by his commoner wife Wan Teh binti Wan Endut (1898 &ndash; 27 December 1952). Born in Arau, he was educated at the Arau Malay School and later at Penang Free School between 1937 and 1939. At the age of 18, he joined the Perlis administrative service, becoming a magistrate and in 1940, was transferred to Kuala Lumpur to serve as Second Magistrate in the Criminal Court.\n\nThe Perlis Succession Dispute\n\nThe fourth Raja of Perlis, Syed Alwi ibni Syed Safi Jamalullail (born 1881; reigned 1905\u20131943) was childless. However, he had several half-brothers who were competing for the role of heir presumptive. The succession to the Perlis throne was not automatic and an heir presumptive had to be confirmed in that post by the State Council comprising the Raja and several others.\n\nSyed Putra's paternal grandfather Syed Mahmud (died 1919), was the oldest son of Raja Syed Safi ibni Almarhum Syed Alwi Jamalullail (the third Raja). He was also a half brother of Raja Syed Alwi. He served as Raja Muda until 1912 when he was convicted and jailed in Alor Star, Kedah until 1917. Two years later, he died in Alor Star. On 6 December 1934, Syed Mahmud's son Syed Hassan was, by a three to one vote, selected by the State Council as Bakal Raja or heir presumptive. However, Syed Hassan died on 18 October 1935.\n\nOn 30 April 1938, again by a three to one vote, the State Council chose Syed Putra (son of Syed Hassan) as the Bakal Raja. This choice was opposed by Syed Hamzah, the younger half-brother of Raja Syed Alwi and himself Vice-President of the State Council on the grounds that Syed Putra was too far removed from the throne under the Islamic inheritance laws (primogeniture did not then apply in Perlis). However, the British colonial rulers supported Syed Putra.\n\nJapanese occupation\n\nOn the outbreak of the World War II, Raja Syed Alwi retreated to Kuala Kangsar, Perak. He returned to Perlis on 28 December 1941 but was already very ill and state affairs were exercised by Syed Hamzah. Syed Putra was at the time serving in the judiciary in Kuala Lumpur and had been advised by Sultan Musa Ghiatuddin Riayat Shah of Selangor to remain there. In May 1942, Syed Hamzah persuaded Raja Syed Alwi to withdraw Syed Putra's appointment as Bakal Raja and instead Syed Hamzah himself was appointed to that post. Raja Syed Alwi died in Arau on 1 February 1943 and a day later, before the funeral, Syed Hamzah was proclaimed fifth Raja of Perlis, by the consent of the Japanese Military Governor of Kedah and Perlis.\n\nSyed Putra and his family stayed in Klang until 15 May 1942 when he returned to Perlis. He lived in a hut near the Arau railway station and received a $90 a month allowance from Raja Syed Alwi but this ceased on the latter's death. On 29 March 1945 he left for Kelantan, the home state of his consort Tengku Budriah, where he sold cakes and sundry goods for a living.\n\nReturn of the British\n\nThe British Military Administration (BMA) under Lord Louis Mountbatten refused to recognise Syed Hamzah as Raja. On 18 September 1945, Syed Hamzah abdicated. He went into exile in Thailand and died in Arau on 20 February 1958.\n\nOn 4 December 1945 the British proclaimed Syed Putra as sixth Raja of Perlis. He returned to Perlis from Kelantan, via Padang Besar. He was installed on 12 March 1949.\n\nThe Malayan Union experiment\n\nRaja Syed Putra objected to the Malayan Union treaty on the grounds that it contravened the 1930 British-Perlis Treaty giving governing power to the Raja-in-council. However, his protests that he signed under duress was rejected by the British. Subsequently, like all other Malay rulers, Raja Syed Putra repudiated the Malayan Union treaty.\n\nElection as Deputy Yang di-Pertuan Agong\n\nRaja Syed Putra was elected Deputy Yang di-Pertuan Agong by the Malay rulers and served in that office from 14 April 1960 until the death of Sultan Hisamuddin Alam Shah on 1 September 1960.\n\nElection as Yang di-Pertuan Agong\n\nRaja Syed Putra was elected as the third Yang di-Pertuan Agong of independent Malaya and served in that office from 21 September 1960. At 39 years and 301 days, he is the youngest Yang di-Pertuan Agong ever elected. He was installed at Istana Negara on 4 January 1961. On 16 September 1963 upon the proclamation of the Malaysian Federation comprising Malaya, British Borneo, Sarawak and Singapore, he became Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia. He completed his term in office on 20 September 1965. His son, Tuanku Syed Sirajuddin was elected as the 12th Yang di-Pertuan Agong and served from 2001 to 2006 after the death of the incumbent, Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah.\n\nRole as Yang di-Pertuan Agong\n\nIn September 1963, Malaysia was formed and Tuanku Syed Putra became known as the last King of Malaya before changed to Malaysia as he was first king under new federation and the only King of Malaysia that Singapore has ever had in modern history.\n\nRaja Syed Putra's term of office as Yang di-Pertuan Agong was marked by the Indonesian Confrontation between newly created Malaysia and its larger neighbour, Indonesia. He offered to stay on as Yang di-Pertuan Agong at the end of his term, to see out the end of Confrontation, but this suggestion was rejected by then prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman.\n\nAs Yang di-Pertuan Agong, he instructed proper treatment of the royal regalia, which he believed was partly responsible for the mysterious final illness and death of Sultan Hisamuddin Alam Shah, his immediate predecessor.\n\nLater role, death and funeral\n\nRaja Syed Putra became the doyen of the Malay rulers, giving advice to more junior Rulers especially during the constitutional crisis with the then prime minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad in 1983 and again in 1993. He died at the National Heart Institute, Kuala Lumpur on 16 April 2000 from a heart attack. At that time, he was the longest reigning monarch in the world, a position he inherited from Franz Joseph II, Prince of Liechtenstein in 1989. He was buried at the Royal Mausoleum in Arau, Perlis.\n\nFamily life\n\nTuanku Syed Putra married twice:\n\nPlaces named after him\n\nSeveral places were named after him, including:",

  "Drink offering\n\nThe drink offering (Hebrew \u05b0\u05e0\u05b6\u05e1\u05b6\u05da, nesekh) was a form of libation forming one of the sacrifices and offerings of the Law of Moses.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe Hebrew noun nesekh is formed from the Qal form of the verb nasakh, \"to pour,\" hence \"thing poured.\" The verb and the noun frequently come together, such as nasakh [aleha] nesekh, literally \"pour [on it] a poured thing\" as in the only pre-Exodus use, that of Jacob's libation at a pillar in Genesis 35:14. The etymology \"poured thing\" explains the existence of the rarer secondary use of the verb nasakh for \"cast\" (an idol), and the noun nesekh for a \"thing poured\" (also an idol).\n\nHebrew Bible\n\nThe drink offering accompanied various sacrifices and offerings on various feast days. Usually the offering was of wine, but in one instance also of \"strong drink\" (Numbers 28:7). This \"strong drink\" (Hebrew shekhar \u05e9\u05b5\u05c1\u05db\u05b8\u05e8, Septuagint sikera \u03c3\u03af\u03ba\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1 as Luke 1:15, but also methusma in Judges 13:4 and Micah 2:11) is not identified.\n\nMishnaic tradition\n\nThe Mishnah (Menachot chapter 8) mentions the places in the Land of Israel and in Transjordan where the finest of the grains, olive harvest and vintage wines were taken as an offertory to the Temple in Jerusalem. Among wine libations, the finest wine was said to have come from Keruthin and Hattulim (ibid., Menachot 8:6), this latter place now tentatively identified by historical geographer Samuel Klein with the ruin directly west of Sha'ar Hagai (B\u00e2b el W\u00e2d) called ''Kh. Kh\u00e2t\u00fbleh (variant spelling: Kh. Kh\u00e2t\u00fbla), now known locally as Giv'at \u1e24atul''. Second in rank to this place was Beit Rima and Beit Luban, both places identified in Samaria. The wine from any country was valid, but they used to bring it only from these places. The drink offerings were poured out near the altar on the Temple Mount, where they fell down into a subterraneous cavern (\u05e9\u05b4\u05c1\u05d9\u05ea), in fulfillment of the Scripture (Numbers 28:7) : \"In the Holy Place you shall pour out a drink offering of strong drink to the Lord.\"\n\nIn the Temple at Jerusalem, they were not permitted to bring wine that had been sweetened or smoked or cooked and if they did so it was invalid. By a rabbinic injunction, an unsealed flagon of wine prepared by an Israelite, but which had been kept under watch or in store by a heathen, is considered a forbidden libation (\u05d9\u05d9\u05df \u05e0\u05e1\u05da), which must be discarded. The kashrut requirements for wine are designed to prevent the accidental or intentional use of wine previously dedicated or blessed for idolatrous use. However, an unsealed flagon of wine that had been cooked or of conditum (both of which prepared by an Israelite), since both are unfit for the altar, even though they had been watched or kept in store by a heathen, can still be consumed by an Israelite.\n\nAncient Near East parallels\n\nIn Akkadian texts, and Ugaritic epics there are references to libations, and sometimes the same verb stem N-S-K \"to pour\" is used. Psalm 16:4 gives reference to a \"drink offering\" of blood among pagans, but generally in ANE religions libations were also of wine.\n\nRabbinical interpretation\n\nIn the Talmud the view of Rabbi Meir was that the blood of the sacrifices permits the drink offering to the altar (B. Zeb. 44a).",

  "Bad Blood (Supergrass song)\n\n\"Bad Blood\" is the second single from British rock group Supergrass' sixth album, Diamond Hoo Ha. It was released on 17 March 2008, which was one week before the album's release date. The song is about a rough night out in Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland, as Gaz Coombes explains;\n\n\"We'd played the Airwaves festival, and it was about four in the morning, and right outside our bedroom window in Reykjav\u00edk there were loads of boozy scuffles. A really beautiful town, peaceful during the day \u2013 then it just went mental at night with drunken fights and shouting. I just thought the contrast was amazing. We carried on writing the lyrics later, using experiences we'd had, wandering around New York City at two in the morning, the worse for wear, and being excited by the dangers, but also being a bit naive. The big line in there is, \"I don't believe that man needs God, thank God\". Then it goes on: \"I can't forget you, you're all I've got my love\". It's saying man doesn't need God, he just needs a good woman.\" This song is featured in Need for Speed: Undercover as one of the tracks used in the series.\n\nGaz Coombes is also quoted as saying that \"Bad Blood\" is about violence and paranoia in the 21st century.\n\nCharts\n\nThe song performed badly in the charts due to lack of airplay; upon its first week of release it only managed to reach #73. The next week, it dropped out of the top 100 completely.\n\nTrack listing\n\nEnhanced CD CDR6755 / DD\n\nLimited edition caramel 7\" R6755\n\nMusic video\n\nThe accompanying video to Bad Blood won the Best Rock Video award at the 2008 UK Music Video Awards.\n\nThe video features the band playing in a stereotypical English pub with the camera fixed on certain objects as they move, creating a swaying sort of effect. The opening scene is that of a reel of recording tape spinning which then pans out to the band themselves. The camera alternates between scenes of a pendulum clock, a mechanical wind-up metronome, a Newton's cradle, a swinging framed picture of Danny Goffey and a framed picture of Gaz Coombes which falls to the floor and smashes. The chandelier above them is also swinging throughout.\n\nAfter the middle eight, the band put on masks that emulate their own faces, and Danny plays his bass drum barefoot. They remove these masks as the chorus begins again, then Gaz kicks over his microphone stand, and smashes his guitar (now replaced with one made from gingerbread). Rob Coombes follows suit by pushing over his keyboard, which is now made of toast, and Danny punches through the skin of his snare drum to reveal that it is in fact filled with popcorn. Mick Quinn joins the rest by smashing his own gingerbread guitar as Gaz continues to thrash his instrument against the floor as well, thus ending the video.\n\nFirst, Gaz Coombes plays his red vintage 1960s Burns/Baldwin Bison guitar, but when it is replaced with gingerbread, it takes on a distinctly more Telecaster shape. Mick Quinn, however, uses the same black Rickenbacker 4003 bass throughout.\n\nKeith Schofield, the director of the video explains: \"We shot everything on a locked-off camera on 35mm and then transferred to HD, We then tracked in a standard-definition frame on top of that HD, and moved the footage through that cropped window. All the action was tracked in post.\"",
  "Rockingham Park\n\nRockingham Park was a 1 mi horse racing establishment in Salem, New Hampshire, in the United States. First built in 1906, it was used as an area for many to gamble on the weekends. Seabiscuit raced there in 1935 and 1936, and Mom's Command ran in her first race and gained her first victory there in 1984. Rockingham Park also hosted simulcasting and charity gaming. The last live horse racing at the track occurred in 2009. Rockingham Park closed its doors for good on August 31, 2016, and was sold for redevelopment of the property. The racetrack was demolished in the summer of 2017. It is currently being redeveloped as part of the Tuscan Village project.\n\nThe New Hampshire Sweepstakes (now New Hampshire Lottery) was originated in 1964 and raced here from 1964 to 1967. The race was brought back in 1984 (though not connected with sweepstakes tickets) and was the feature event of the summer racing meet.\n\nIn 1991, the Mall at Rockingham Park, currently the largest mall in northern New England, was constructed adjacent to the racetrack, and has Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, Sears, J. C. Penney, Macy's (originally Jordan Marsh), and Lord & Taylor for anchors. The mall is owned and managed by Simon Property Group and is not affiliated with the racetrack.\n\n\"The Finest Racecourse in the World\"\n\nOn June 28, 1906, a tiny outpost near the Salem train depot began a 21-day tenure as host to a Thoroughbred meet. Over 10,000 people from as far away as New York City flocked to the small New Hampshire town. Their rave reviews proclaimed the site \"the finest racecourse in the world\". Although Alyth, a two-year-old, won the first thoroughbred race at the site, gambling was still illegal at the time in New Hampshire, and betting was shut down after three days. Underground wagering continued throughout the meet, but the track sat idle for five years after the meet's conclusion; however, these humble beginnings would lead to the formation of a staple of New England culture rich with the history of the \"sport of kings.\"\n\nIdle years\n\nIn between its stints as a racecourse, the site served as host to a number of historical occurrences. Before the return of racing, Rockingham Park hosted the first aviation meet in northern New England in 1911, where Lieutenant Milling set a new altitude record of 1600 ft in his biplane.\n\nThe track also served as the base for the 14th US Army Corps of Engineers during World War I. The racecourse served as a bivouac for soldiers prior to voyages to France.\n\nThe racetrack was idled again when on July 29, 1980 a fire destroyed the grandstand. The track remained closed until May 26, 1984.\n\nMotor racing venue\n\nThe establishment has hosted motorized racing. On July 4, 1925, the track was used for a 100 mi race with an average speed of 76.8 mph. Motorcycle races were also held. With the success of the events, a 1.25 mi board track was built, sanctioned by the AAA, the most recognized sanctioning body of the day. A mechanic was killed in practice for the 250 mi Autumn Classic car race, which was staged on October 31, 1925. On August 21, 1926, M. L. \"Curly\" Fredericks, on an Altoona, set the record for the fastest speed (120.3 mph) that a motorcycle would attain on an oval board track. In 1928, the track held the final motorcycle national championships to be competed on a board track. With the rotten wood removed, the 1929 Labor Day and Columbus Day auto races held at the restored dirt track drew 45,000 and 52,000 spectators respectively.",
  "Campus, Illinois\n\nCampus is a village in Round Grove and Broughton townships, Livingston County, Illinois, United States. The population was 166 at the 2010 census.\n\nHistory\n\nCampus was laid out and platted by Charles William Sheldon (1839-1911) in April 1880, along the Wabash Railroad on his farm of 640 acre. The town was named \"Campus\" because the many trees made someone think of a college campus.\n\nSheldon was a farmer and he owned the first business in town, Campus Brick & Tile Co. He later sold the company, which passed through several owners before closing in 1952. Over the years the tile company produced millions of feet of drain tile and was one of the principal industries in the town.\n\nThomas Feehery (1839-1926) built the first store and post office in Campus. The Chariton brothers built the second store in town. In 1896 Mrs. Gorman opened a hotel. Other businesses at that time included Ole Nelson and Thomas Connors' livery stable.\n\nCampus had a water system by 1894. The town also had street lights, cement sidewalks, an electric light plant and tile drains, which were great improvements for such an isolated rural town in those early years.\n\nThe town had a disastrous fire in 1897 that destroyed three of the business houses. A brick building was built on the ruins.\n\nSacred Heart Catholic Church was the first brick structure in the village. The Catholic Church had its start in the area in the 1870s when a small church was built in Broughton Township a mile south of Campus. The building was later moved into town.\n\nThe present brick building on Elm Street was begun in June 1983 and completed a year later. A rectory was built next to the church. A convent school was built in 1898 on the other side of Elm Street. The school closed in 1930 and was vacant for several years. It later served as a vocation center and home for priests.\n\nBy the 1970s the former school building had become a rooming house and laundromat. The beautiful building later became vacant and in disrepair.\n\nJoseph Zeller (1918-2018), Pennsylvania businessman and state legislator, was born in Campus.\n\nGeography\n\nCampus is located in northeastern Livingston County at 41.02361\u00b0N, -88.30639\u00b0W (41.023691, -88.306503). Most of the village is in Round Grove Township, but four blocks of the village are in Broughton Township to the south. Campus is 11 mi by road southeast of Dwight.\n\nAccording to the 2010 census, Campus has a total area of 0.09 sqmi, all land.\n\nDemographics\n\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 145 people, 40 households, and 31 families residing in the village. The population density was 1,459.1 PD/sqmi. There were 45 housing units at an average density of 452.8 /sqmi. The racial makeup of the village was 100.00% White. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.38% of the population.\n\nThere were 40 households, out of which 55.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 60.0% were married couples living together, 10.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 22.5% were non-families. 15.0% of all households were made up of individuals, and 7.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.63 and the average family size was 4.10.\n\nIn the village, the population was spread out, with 42.1% under the age of 18, 9.0% from 18 to 24, 32.4% from 25 to 44, 10.3% from 45 to 64, and 6.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 24 years. For every 100 females, there were 119.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 100.0 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the village was $47,750, and the median income for a family was $49,250. Males had a median income of $36,250 versus $21,250 for females. The per capita income for the village was $19,005. There were 3.7% of families and 3.4% of the population living below the poverty line, including 7.5% of under eighteens and none of those over 64.",
  "Atari 810\n\nThe Atari 810 is the official floppy disk drive for the Atari 400 and 800, the first two models in the Atari 8-bit family of home computers. It was released by Atari, Inc. in 1980. The single-density drive provides 90 kB of storage. The 810 has a data transfer rate of 6 kbps in most cases and a number of reliability issues. Third-party enhancements such as the Happy 810 address these problems as do replacement drives like the Indus GT with more storage and other features.\n\nAt the same time as the 810, Atari announced the double-density Atari 815, allowing 180 kB per disk, with two drives in one case. It was never put into full production.\n\nThe 810 was replaced by the Atari 1050 with the release of the XL series machines in 1983. It was replaced in turn in 1987 by the XF551 with a double-sided, double-density 360 kB mode.\n\nAtari vs. Apple\n\nThe machines that emerged as the Atari 8-bit family had originally been designed as part of a project to develop a driver chipset for a new games console. During the time the chips were being developed, the Apple II became very popular and propelled Apple Computer into one of the largest initial public offerings of its era. Atari, recently purchased by Warner Communications, had placed Ray Kassar in the CEO position in March 1978. He decided to redirect the chipset to the emerging home computer market to take on Apple.\n\nOne of the key reasons for the Apple II's success was the Disk II, introduced in June 1978 at the very low (for the era) price of $495 plus the interface card. The interface was based on a system Steve Wozniak had previously built while working at Hewlett-Packard to control a Shugart Associates SA-400 floppy drive. Steve Jobs went to Shugart and asked for a stripped-down drive mechanism for $100; Shugart responded by shipping them 25 prototypes of a new model they called the SA-390. Woz's controller then provided the bits that Shugart had removed, allowing two drives to be controlled by a single card. The resulting system operated at 15 kbps, making it faster than any of the competing designs of the era.\n\nNew design\n\nThe new Atari machines faced the problem that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) had recently introduced standards to deal with the profusion of systems that connected to televisions that were causing significant problems with interference. The new rules were extremely strict, requiring a lengthy and costly testing suite to be run against any new product and anything that connected to it. Apple avoided this by not connecting to a television; instead, a 3rd party sold the required RF modulator and thus Apple didn't need testing. Atari was determined to make a plug-and-play system that connected directly to the television, like the Atari VCS. This precluded the idea of having expansion slots that could be connected to external equipment, like on the Apple, as the openings would be difficult to shield property to avoid RF leakage.\n\nThis led to the introduction of the SIO serial bus, a system that allowed devices to be daisy chained to a single port. Using a cable made shielding to the required levels much easier, but also required the external devices to host the interface circuitry that would normally be placed on an expansion card inside the machine. This drove up the complexity and cost of the external devices. To offset this as much as possible, Atari used discarded MOS 6507 chips from the VCS production line. Atari had long relied on Signetic's 6507s being rated for 1 MHz but most of them actually being able to run at a slightly higher 1.1 MHz that the VCS worked at. Some of the deliveries invariably didn't hit 1.1, and those were otherwise useless and thus essentially free.\n\nAtari's drives entered the market almost two years later than Apple, giving them time to take advantage of the rapid improvements taking place in the industry. Most notable was the entry of several other manufacturers to the drive space, including Alps Electric and Micro Peripherals Inc (MPI). Atari arranged a deal with MPI for their mechanisms and designed their own controller to drive it, combining the 6507 running at 500 kHz with a standard FM encoding drive controller, the Western Digital FD1771.\n\nIn spite of these efforts, the resulting drive was still more expensive than the Disk II, listed at $599 when it was introduced in 1979. It also had the disadvantage of running more slowly than the Disk II; although the underlying SIO bus was running at 19.2 kbps, the effective data rate was generally around 6 kbps, compared to about 15 kbps for the Disk II. This is one reason the machine was never considered seriously in the business market; applications like VisiCalc were not competitive with the Apple II when run on the Atari or Commodore 64.\n\nIn a 1982 review for a third party replacement, InfoWorld described the 810 as \"noisy, slow and inefficient by today's standards, and it had some reliability problems\" and then described the sounds as \"At times it almost seemed sick, the groans and creaks were so intense.\" Brian Moriarty, writing in the ANALOG Computing magazine, described it as having \"notoriously poor speed regulation\" in maintaining its non-standard 288 RPM, while Garry Francis noted in Page 6 magazine that the speed would tend to drift over time, causing disks written at different speeds to become unreadable without adjustment. This led to a number of small programs, like Snail and Drive RPM, that would test the speed of the drive in software in order to aid the user in adjusting it back to 288.\n\nInitial units shipped with Atari DOS 1.0, sometimes known as DOS I. This was replaced by DOS 2.0S in 1981.\n\n815\n\nWhile the 8-bit machines were first being introduced, the first MFM double-density drive controllers were appearing, allowing the same disks to store twice as much data, 180 kB. Early advertising for the new machines often showed the 815, which combined two drives in a single case and used MFM encoding. The price was listed at $1,495.\n\nFor reasons unknown, the 815 was never produced in quantity. Small numbers were hand-built using Tandon drives during 1980 and a few shipped to customers starting in June, but full-scale production never began. It continued to appear on company price lists for the next year, with the last known reference being Atari's internal price list of 24 August 1981.\n\nTo support the larger storage capacity, the drives used a modified version of DOS 2.0, 2.0D. The controller was custom and only supported MFM, making the 815 incompatible with disks used in the 810.\n\nThird party upgrades\n\nThird parties exploring the capabilities of the 810 system soon demonstrated that the 19.2 kbps speed of the SIO communications could be easily doubled. It was later revealed that the speed was not a limitation of the SIO port, but the maximum speed of the logic analyzer available in the lab where it was being developed. Best known among the many products was the Happy 810, introduced in 1982. It added a buffer able to cache one entire track of data, and along with the associated Warp Speed software, increased read performance about three times, making it very competitive with the Apple II.\n\nThe performance and reliability problems with the 810 also led to a thriving market for third-party drives like the Rana 1000 and Indus GT, along with a wide selection of replacements for Atari DOS. Combining one of these drives with a replacement DOS offered higher performance and often true double-density support. As the double-density format had been set with the 815 in 1980, these drives used that format as the basis for their disks as well.\n\nReplacement\n\nIn April 1982, Atari began the process of designing improved version of the 8-bit series, then referred to as the Sweet 8 and Sweet 16. Changes to the plans led to only one of these designs being released as the 1200XL. Containing \"no true innovations\", the most notable change was the introduction of a new design language from Regan Cheng using off-white and black plastics will brushed metal overlay on switches and other fixtures. This led to the introduction of a new line of peripherals that matched the styling. Initially this included the Atari 1010 cassette deck, the Atari 1020 plotter, and 1025 printers.\n\nWhen the 1200XL was introduced at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show in December 1982, there was no sign of a new floppy drive. One reviewer noted that when he went looking all he could find was the \"old model 810 clunkers\", and speculated that \"we will be seeing a new drive from Atari within the next half year\". This prediction came true; when the 1200XL finally reached the market in June 1983, it was accompanied by the new Atari 1050. It offered the new \"enhanced\" or \"dual density\" option that improved formatted capacity to 130 kB, although it was some time before DOS was upgraded to support it. The 1050 quickly replaced the 810 in the market.\n\nDescription\n\nThe 810 case was designed by Roy Nishi and Russ Farnell. It used identical C-shaped sections for the top and bottom of the drive, with rings embossed into the case where rubber feet were adhered on the bottom during assembly. This meant the feet on one drive were naturally positioned over the empty rings on the top of the drive below it, providing sturdy stacking. The front of the case had the power switch",

  "Farrukh-Zad of Ghazna\n\nFarrukh-Zad (Full name: Jamal ad-Dawlah Abu Shuja Farrukh-Zad), was sultan of the Ghaznavid Empire from (1053 \u2013 4 April 1059). His reign was considered one of benevolence, prosperity and tranquility for the Ghaznavid empire. It was free of the chaotic turbulence and greed from palace ghulams until the end of his reign. He was a very devout Muslim and fasted during Rajab, Sha'ban and Ramadan.\n\nBiography\n\nHaving been at the fortress of Barghund, Farrukh-Zad was one of the Ghaznavid princes that escaped the usurper Toghrul's massacre in 1052.\n\nFarrukh employed Abd al-Razzaq Maymandi, a former vizier of Maudud and Abd Rashid, but later had him dismissed and imprisoned. He also freed Abul-Fazl Bayhaqi from his imprisonment and it was during Farrukh's reign that Bayhaqi wrote his Mujalladat (Tarikh-e Beyhaqi).\n\nFollowing the chaos of Toghrul's usurpation, Chagri Beg sent a Seljuq army to take Ghazni, but the ghulam general Khirghiz intercepted and defeated it.\n\nAround 1058, Farrukh had his army invade Tukharistan in hopes of removing the Seljuqs. His army was initially successful, capturing the Seljuq Atabeg Qutb ad-Din Kul-Sarigh. However, Alp Arslan counter-attacked and defeated the Ghaznavid army, capturing many of its commanders. A subsequent peace treaty, drawn up by Abul-Fazl Bayhaqi, allowed for an exchange of prisoners and a mutual non-aggression pact.\n\nDeath\n\nIn 1058, palace ghulams attempted to assassinate Farrukh in his bath, but he grabbed a sword and held them at bay until his guards arrived and killed the ghulams. Depressed and sickened by the attempt on his life, Farrukh-Zad withdrew from worldly affairs and died of colitis on 4 April 1059 at the age of thirty-four. He succeeded by his brother Ibrahim.",

  "St Serf's Inch\n\nSt Serf's Inch or St Serf's Island is an island in Loch Leven, in south-eastern Perth and Kinross, Scotland. It was the home of a Culdee and then an Augustinian monastic community, St Serf's Inch Priory.\n\nHistory\n\nThere was a monastic community on the island which was old in the 12th century. The monastery produced a series of Gaelic language charters from the 11th and 12th centuries which were translated into Latin in the late 12th century. It is from these that we know Macbeth, the King of Scots and his consort Gruoch, made an endowment of land to the priory. One of these charters purports to go back to Brude filius Dergard, that is Bruide mac Dargarto, King of the Picts (d. 706). Other of these charters record grants from M\u00e1el D\u00fain, Bishop of St Andrews (d. 1055), his successor T\u00faathal (d. c. 1060), his successor Fothad mac Ma\u00edl M\u00edch\u00e9il, King M\u00e1el Coluim III (1058\u20131093) and his wife Margaret, Ethelred, abbot of Dunkeld, and King Domnall B\u00e1n (1093-1097). Also among the collection of these translations is a record of a trial held c. 1128 and presided over by Causant\u00edn, Mormaer of Fife and magnum judex in Scotia, assisted by Dufgal filium Mocche and Meildoineneth filium Machedath; the trial pertained to the behaviour of one Robert \"the Burgundian\", the earliest recorded French settler north of the Forth, towards the monks of St Serf, and resulted in favour of the monks after Causant\u00edn bowed to the \"superior knowledge\" of the law held by \"Dufgal\".\n\nPrior Andrew of Wyntoun, author of the 15th century historical work called Oryginalle Cronykil of Scotland included various unflattering stories about his monarch. Macbeth was described as a 'changeling' or 'Devil's child'. Andrew also recorded a number of tales that were referenced in William Shakespeare's 'Scottish Play', including a prophecy that Macbeth would never be killed by a man born of woman, his recognition by three 'Weird Sisters', and that his demise would only come when the wood of Birnam came to Dunsinane.",

  "Micropterix\n\nMicropterix is a genus of small primitive metallic moths, in the insect order lepidoptera within the family Micropterigidae. The name was raised by the German entomologist, Jacob H\u00fcbner in 1825 and comes from the Greek for mikros, little and pterux, a wing. The moths are distributed across Europe, south to North Africa and east as far as Japan.\n\nDescription\n\nThe moths are small, with the forewing ranging in size from 2.5 mm to 5.5 mm, and at rest they are held at a steep angle, tent-like over the body. Unique among the lepidoptera, the moths have chewing mouthparts rather than a proboscis and are most easily seen feeding, often in large aggregations, on the pollen of the flowers of many herbaceous plants, shrubs and trees. Eggs are translucent white and laid amongst vegetation on the surface of the soil. The life history of the early stages is more or less unknown but larva have been found in the young shoots of plants, or obtained by the funnel extraction of woodland turf samples, from a depth of up to 10 cm. It appears there are only three instars and they probably feed on minute particles of leaf-litter or possibly fungal hyphae. For many species the pupa is unknown, but of those found it is within a tough silken cocoon.\n\nEdward Meyrick describes the moth as: \"Mandibles developed. No tongue. Labial palpi obsolete.

  "Ben Corlaciu\n\nBenedict Corlaciu (March 6, 1924&ndash;June 16, 1981) was a Romanian poet and prose writer.\n\nBorn in Gala\u021bi, his parents were Neculai Corlaciu and his wife Rozalia. After attending primary and high school in Bucharest, he graduated from the literature and philosophy faculty of Bucharest University in 1947. He was a proofreader for Timpul newspaper; an editor at Frontul plugarilor and Flac\u0103ra; a cultural officer at the Bucharest Writers' House (1965-1968); and coordinator of the literary almanac edited by the Romanian Writers' Union (1968-1970). In 1975, he emigrated from Romania and settled in Paris, where he died several years later. As a result of his departure, the communist regime banned his works and removed his name from literary dictionaries and histories.\n\nIn 1941, Corlaciu entered the circle surrounding Albatros magazine, together with Geo Dumitrescu and Dinu Pillat; in 1944, he joined the Romanian Writers' Society. He made his published debut in Albatros, and also contributed to Vremea, Timpul and Revista Funda\u021biilor Regale. His first volume of poetry was the 1941 Tavernale, followed by Pelerinul serilor (1942), Arhipelag (1943) and Manifest liric (1945; Editura Forum Prize). These were typical for the World War II generation, marked by a spectacular attitude of revolt, with avant-garde echoes, but also marked by the symbolism of George Bacovia. The romantic pose of damnation, the social revolt and ironic fantasy grouped him with generational colleagues Dumitrescu, Dimitrie Stelaru, Constant Tonegaru and Ion Caraion. He next published poetry in 1969, with the anthology Poezii. This included not only the earlier work but also an ample section called Postumele and covering 1945-1967; the latter show a retreat from the manifesto poem and an evolution toward more interior forms of lyricism. Poeme florivore (1972) marks a return to the earlier style of poetry. His intended title, Explozia sertar, was censored, but allowed to appear in the massive anthology Starea de urgen\u021b\u0103, also from 1972. His last poetry book was Arcul biologic (1974).\n\nHe published the novel Moartea l\u00e2ng\u0103 cer (1946). During the socialist realist period, this was followed by short stories and reportages that conformed to the era's dictates: La tr\u00e2nt\u0103 cu mun\u021bii, 1949; Candidatul, 1950; Timpii de aur, 1951; P\u00e2inea p\u0103cii, 1951; Noaptea de la Ipote\u0219ti. Dou\u0103 episoade, 1957. He later published two other novels: Cazul doctor Udrea (1959) and Baritina (1965, republished in 1972 as C\u00e2nd sim\u021bi c\u0103 moare v\u00e2ntul).",

  "Concealed carry in the United States\n\nConcealed carry, or carrying a concealed weapon (CCW), is the practice of carrying a weapon (such as a handgun) in public in a concealed manner, either on one's person or in close proximity. CCW is often practiced as a means of self-defense. Every state in the United States allows for concealed carry of a handgun either permitless or with a permit, although the difficulty in obtaining a permit varies per jurisdiction.\n\nThere is conflicting evidence regarding the effect that concealed carry has on crime rates. A comprehensive 2004 literature review by the National Academy of Sciences concluded that there is no link between the existence of laws that allow concealed carry and crime rates, while a 2020 review by the Rand Corporation concluded that there is evidence that concealed carry may increase violent crime.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Second Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees the right to \"keep and bear arms\". Concealed weapons bans were passed in Kentucky and Louisiana in 1813. (In those days open carry of weapons for self-defense was considered acceptable; concealed carry was denounced as the practice of criminals.) By 1859, Indiana, Tennessee, Virginia, Alabama, and Ohio had followed suit. By the end of the nineteenth century, similar laws were passed in places such as Texas, Florida, and Oklahoma, which protected some gun rights in their state constitutions. Before the mid-1900s, most U.S. states had passed concealed carry laws rather than banning weapons completely. Until the late 1990s, many Southern states were either \"No-Issue\" or \"Restrictive May-Issue\". Since then, these states have largely enacted \"Shall-Issue\" licensing laws, with numerous states legalizing \"Unrestricted concealed carry\" and the remaining \"May-issue\" licensing laws being abolished in 2022 by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nState laws\n\n[[Image:Concealed carry across USA by county.svg|thumb|310x310px|Requirement to obtain a concealed carry permit by state/territory (2022):\n\n]]\n\nPermitting policies\n\nHistorically, some states were considered \"may-issue\" jurisdictions where an applicant was required to provide a proper cause or need to be issued a permit to carry a concealed weapon. On June 23, 2022, these laws were found unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen.\n\nRegulations differ widely by state, with half of the fifty states either currently maintaining a constitutional carry policy or implementing it in the near future.\n\nThe Federal Gun-Free School Zones Act limits where an unlicensed person may carry; carry of a weapon, openly or concealed, within 1000 feet of a school zone is prohibited, with exceptions granted in the federal law to holders of valid state-issued weapons permits (state laws may reassert the illegality of school zone carry by license holders), and under LEOSA to current and honorably retired law enforcement officers (regardless of permit, usually trumping state law).\n\nWhen in contact with an officer, some states require individuals to inform that officer that they are carrying a handgun.\n\nNot all weapons that fall under CCW laws are lethal. For example, in Florida, carrying pepper spray in more than a specified volume (2 oz.) of chemical requires a CCW permit, whereas everyone may legally carry a smaller, \u201cself-defense chemical spray\u201d device hidden on their person without a CCW permit. there have been 21.52 million concealed weapon permits issued in the United States.\n\nUnrestricted jurisdictions\n\nAn unrestricted jurisdiction is one in which a permit is not required to carry a concealed handgun. This is sometimes called constitutional carry. Within the unrestricted category, there exist states that are fully unrestricted, where no permit is required for lawful open or concealed carry, and partially unrestricted, where certain forms of concealed carry may be legal without a permit, while other forms of carry may require a permit.\n\nSome states have a limited form of permitless carry, restricted based on one or more of the following: a person's location, the loaded/unloaded state of the firearm, or the specific persons who may carry without a permit., these states are Illinois, New Mexico, and Washington. Some states that allow permitless concealed carry and still issue concealed carry permits may impose restrictions on concealed carry for certain places and/or at certain times (e.g., special events, large public gatherings, etc.). In some such situations, those holding a valid concealed carry permit may be exempt from such restrictions.\n\nPermit requirement jurisdictions\n\nA permit requirement jurisdiction is one in which a government-issued permit is required to carry a concealed handgun in public. Before the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen, these jurisdictions were further split between \"shall-issue\", which is the current national licensing standard where the granting of licenses is subject only to meeting determinate criteria laid out in the law, and \"may-issue\" where the granting of such licenses was at the discretion of local authorities. Since the abolishment of \"may-issue\" permitting the U.S. Supreme Court has stated it is still legal for U.S. jurisdictions subject to the Constitution to require a permit to carry a concealed handgun, and that background checks, training, and proper fees can be required without violating the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution which guarantees a right of the people to carry a concealed firearm outside of the home.\n\nConcealed carry on U.S. military installations\n\nWhile members of the Armed Services may receive extensive small arms training, United States Military installations have some of the most restrictive rules for the possession, transport, and carrying of personally-owned firearms in the country.\n\nOverall authority for carrying a personally-owned firearm on a military installation rests with the installation commander, although the authority to permit individuals to carry firearms on an installation is usually delegated to the Provost Marshal. Military installations do not recognize state-issued concealed carry permits, and state firearms laws generally do not apply to military bases, regardless of the state in which the installation is located. Federal law (18 USC, Section 930) generally forbids the possession, transport, and carrying of firearms on military installations without approval from the installation commander. Federal law gives installation commanders wide discretion in establishing firearms policies for their respective installations. In practice, local discretion is often constrained by policies and directives from the headquarters of each military branch and major commands.\n\nInstallation policies can vary from no-issue for most bases to shall-issue in rare circumstances. Installations that do allow the carrying of firearms typically restrict carrying to designated areas and for specific purposes (i.e., hunting or officially sanctioned shooting competitions in approved locations on the installation). Installation commanders may require the applicant complete extensive firearms safety training, undergo a mental health evaluation, and obtain a letter of recommendation from their unit commander (or employer) before such authorization is granted. Personnel that reside on a military installation are typically required to store their personally-owned firearms in the installation armory, although the installation commander or provost marshal may permit a service member to store their personal firearms in their on-base dwelling if they have a gun safe or similarly designed cabinet where the firearms can be secured.\n\nPrior to 2011, military commanders could impose firearms restrictions to servicemembers residing off-base, such as mandatory registration of firearms with the base Provost Marshal, restricting or banning the carrying of firearms by servicemembers either on or off the installation regardless of whether the member had a state permit to carry, and requiring servicemembers to have a gun safe or similar container to secure firearms when not in use. A provision was included in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 that limited commanders' authority to impose restrictions on the possession and use of personally-owned firearms by service members who reside off-base.\n\nConcealed carry on Native American Reservations\n\nConcealed carry policies on Native American reservations are covered by the tribal laws for each reservation, which vary widely from \"No-Issue\" to \"Shall-Issue\" and \"Unrestricted\" either in law or in practice. Some Native American tribes recognize concealed carry permits for the state(s) in which the reservation is located, while others do not. For reservations that do not recognize state-issued concealed carry permits, some completely ban concealed carry, while others offer a tribal permit for concealed carry issued by the tribal police or tribal council. Tribal concealed carry permits may be available to the general populace or limited to tribal members, depending on tribal policies. Tribal law typically pre-empts state law on the reservation. The only exception is while traversing the reservation on a state-owned highway (including interstate, U.S. routes, and in some instances county roads), in which case state law and the federal Firearm Owners' Protection Act (FOPA) apply.\n\nLimitations on concealed carry\n\nProhibitions of the concealed carry of firearms and other weapons by local governments predate the establishment of the United States. In 1686, New Jersey law stated \u201cno person or persons \u2026 shall presume privately to wear any pocket pistol \u2026 or other unusual or unlawful weapons within this Province.\u201d After the federal government was established, states and localities continued to restrict people from carrying hidden weapons. Tennessee law prohibited this as early as 1821. By 1837, Georgia passed into effect \u201cAn Act to guard and protect the citizens of this State, against the unwarrantable and too prevalent use of deadly weapons.\u201d Two years later, Alabama followed suit with \u201cAn Act to Suppress the Evil Practice of Carrying Weapons Secretly.\u201d Delaware prohibited the practice in 1852. Ohio did the same in 1859, a policy that remained in effect until 1974. Cities",
  "Can't Hardly Wait\n\nCan't Hardly Wait is a 1998 American teen romantic comedy film written and directed by Deborah Kaplan and Harry Elfont. It stars an ensemble cast including Ethan Embry, Charlie Korsmo, Lauren Ambrose, Peter Facinelli, Seth Green, and Jennifer Love Hewitt, and is notable for a number of \"before-they-were-famous\" appearances by teen stars. The story takes place at a high school graduation party in the 1990s.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics. It grossed a total of $25 million at the North American domestic box office, against a production budget of $10 million. The soundtrack peaked at number 25 on the Billboard 200 chart.\n\nConcept\n\nThe story takes place at a high school graduation party in the late 1990s and in a style much like that of the high school movies of the 1980s. The filmmakers were inspired by their observation that in most teen films the best scenes were the party scenes, and decided to make a movie set entirely at a party.\n\nThe film takes its name from The Replacements' song of the same title, from their 1987 album Pleased to Meet Me, which plays over the film's closing credits.\n\nPlot\n\nIn 1998, the senior class of a suburban high school, Huntington Hillside High, are attending a graduation party at a large house owned by a rich class member's family. Among them are Preston Meyers, a typical outsider who plans to proclaim his love to his four-year secret crush Amanda Beckett. Amanda, the most popular girl in school and the senior class prom queen, has recently been dumped by her popular jock boyfriend Mike Dexter. Mike is targeted by nerd classmate William Lichter, who is plotting revenge against him for years of relentless bullying. Preston's antisocial best friend Denise Fleming has no intention of going to the party, but is dragged along by Preston. Kenny Fisher is a wannabe thug who plans on losing his virginity by the end of the night.\n\nAmanda is consoled by her popular girlfriends, whom she realizes she has nothing in common with, and her own second-cousin, who tries to hit on her. She tries to figure out if she has an identity beyond only being known as \"Mike Dexter's girlfriend\". She discovers a letter addressed to her by Preston and, moved by its contents, makes it her mission to find him, but she doesn't know what he looks like and no one she asks gives any helpful descriptions. Meanwhile, Denise and Kenny wind up locking themselves inside an upstairs bathroom away from the party by accident, where they talk about their old friendship and how they had drifted apart; their conversation leads to the restoration of their friendship and escalates into them having sex.\n\nLater, an intoxicated Mike learns from Trip McNeely\u2014a graduate and former stud from his high school\u2014that in college, guys like them are \"a dime a dozen\". Trip emphasizes how he dumped his girlfriend in the same fashion that Mike did to \"score\" with other women and was unsuccessful. Terrified of this prospect, Mike tries to get Amanda back, but she is happier without him and humiliates him in front of everyone at the party. After seeing the school jock turned down, multiple men begin to hit on her, much to her disgust. Preston finds Amanda and confesses his love, but since she still hasn't learned what he looks like, she assumes he is another pervert and rejects him in front of the entire party as well. She later realizes her mistake when she sees Preston's yearbook picture and tries to find him, but he has already driven home in disappointment.\n\nAt the same time, William devises his plan to get revenge on Mike and goes into the party to drive Mike out. While inside the party, William begins drinking alcohol to fit in, and drinks enough to make him forget the entire reason he was there. An impromptu sing-along to Guns N' Roses' \"Paradise City\" causes him to become popular, with multiple women trying desperately to have sex with him. Soon after, William begins talking with Mike, who apologizes for bullying him. William forgives him; the two bond and seemingly become friends. When Mike and William are jailed as a result of a police bust, Mike takes the blame.\n\nThe next morning, when William sees Mike and his friends at a diner, he tries to thank Mike for taking the fall. But Mike acts as though he remembers nothing that happened the previous night and ridicules William in front of his friends. Meanwhile, Preston is at a train station about to leave for Boston when Amanda arrives and asks him about the letter. Preston confesses he wrote it and is about to depart for a writing workshop with Kurt Vonnegut. The two say goodbye and Preston walks away, but he then stops and runs back to Amanda and they share a kiss.\n\nThe epilogue explains what happened to all of the main characters:\n\nProduction\n\nThe script for Can't Hardly Wait was originally written in 1996, by Harry Elfont and Deborah Kaplan who were looking for a project they could develop and direct themselves on a limited budget. The project was approved by Columbia Pictures in mid-1997, following the success of teen-oriented horror film Scream in early 1997. Principal photography for Can't Hardly Wait started in October 1997, and ran for 26 days. Jennifer Love Hewitt was known for Party of Five when she signed on to the film, and appeared in the slasher hit I Know What You Did Last Summer, which helped to further raise her profile. According to Charlie Korsmo, Adam Hann-Byrd was originally cast as William Lichter.\n\nThe cast had a week of rehearsals before filming.\n\nThe film initially received an R-Rating due to MPAA objections about the depiction of teens drinking alcohol at an unsupervised party and drug use. The film was recut to receive a PG-13 rating.\n\nBox office\n\nCan't Hardly Wait was released on June 12, 1998, and grossed $8,025,910 in its opening weekend.

Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade \"B+\" on scale of A to F.\n\nKevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times wrote: \"For all its nonstop energy and high spirits, Can't Hardly Wait allows its characters to emerge as fully dimensional individuals; they've been written with care and perception and played with equal aplomb by a roster of talented young actors\". Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote: \"Can't Hardly Wait has freshness, comic invention and an engaging romantic spirit.\" Stephen Thompson of The A.V. Club wrote: \"But the film deserves credit, both for its breezy pacing and its uncommon tendency to make its characters smarter and geekier than they might have been.\"\n\nEmanuel Levy of Variety called the film a \"mediocre attempt to recapture the exuberance and candid portraiture of such high school movie classics as American Graffiti, Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Dazed and Confused.\" Levy praised the cast but was critical of the \"uneven script and rough direction\". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 1.5 stars out of 4, and wrote: \"The kind of movie that somehow succeeds in moving very, very slowly even while proceeding at a breakneck pace. It cuts quickly back and forth between nothing and nothing... It doesn't have the zing of life and subversion that the best high school movies always have.\"\n\nAwards\n\nIn 2012, Entertainment Weekly ranked Can't Hardly Wait number 44 on its list of the 50 Best High School Movies of all time.\n\nSequel\n\nOn May 25, 2019, on Danny Pellegrino's \"Everything Iconic\" podcast - Jennifer Love Hewitt revealed that she is developing Can't Hardly Wait 2 with plans to direct it herself.

  "London Drugs Ltd v Kuehne &amp; Nagel International Ltd\n\nLondon Drugs Ltd v Kuehne & Nagel International Ltd, [1992] 3 SCR 299 is a leading decision of the Supreme Court of Canada on privity of contract.\n\nBackground\n\nKuehne & Nagel was storing a transformer owned by London Drugs valued at $32,000. The agreement between the parties included a limitation of liability clause which limited liability for damage to the transformer to $40. Two employees were moving the transformer with a forklift and negligently dropped it.\n\nLondon Drugs sued the two employees on the basis that they owed a separate duty of care and could not seek protection under the contract.\n\nThe courts below\n\nLondon Drugs succeeded at first instance at the British Columbia Supreme Court, where the trial judge found the employees personally liable for the full amount of the damages, limiting the company's liability to $40. That judgment was reversed in part on appeal to the British Columbia Court of Appeal, where, in a majority decision, the employees' liability was reduced to $40.\n\nLondon Drugs appealed this decision and the respondent employees cross\u2011appealed, arguing that they should be completely free of liability.\n\nAt the Supreme Court of Canada\n\nThe appeal was dismissed in a 6\u20130 ruling, while the cross-appeal was dismissed 5\u20131.\n\nThe majority opinion\n\nIacobucci J, writing for the majority, observed:\n\nThere is no general rule in Canada to the effect that an employee acting in the course of his or her employment and performing the \"very essence\" of his or her employer's contractual obligations with a customer, does not owe a duty of care, whether one labels it \"independent\" or otherwise, to the employer's customer.\n\nThe mere fact that the employee is performing the \"very essence\" of a contract between the plaintiff and his or her employer does not, in itself, necessarily preclude a conclusion that a duty of care was present.\n\nWhile the employees were liable in negligence, they were able to gain protection under the contract. Employees are able to gain protection where:\n\nConcurrence by McLachlin\n\nMcLachlin J concurred, but for different reasons. Tort and contract constitute separate legal regimes, and the appellant's action against the employees in this case is necessarily in tort, since there was no contract between them. The theory of voluntary assumption of the risk permits an employee sued in tort to rely on a term of limitation in his employer's contract. The plaintiff, having agreed to the limitation of liability vis \u00e0 vis the employer, must be taken to have done so with respect to the employer's employees.\n\nConcurrence/dissent by La Forest\n\nLa Forest J, in dissent, believed the respondent employees did not owe any duty of care to the appellant in the circumstances of this case. He applied the \"Anns test\" as formulated by the House of Lords, which asks:\n\nIn the present case, the first question is answered in the affirmative. As to the second, he felt that the vicarious liability regime is best seen as a response to a number of policy concerns:\n\nThe employee remains liable to the plaintiff for his independent torts. An independent tort may fall within or outside the range of the employer's liability under the vicarious liability regime. In that regard, the following questions must be answered:\n\nSince the conduct of the employees was covered by the contract, the plaintiffs were considered to have voluntarily assumed the risk of their tortious behaviour. The plaintiffs could not have reasonably relied on the employees and, thus, the employees were shielded from liability.\n\nAftermath\n\nThere has been much discussion about the nature of the ruling in two areas:\n\nThe majority ruling, which shielded the employees' liability by virtue of contractual terms, has invited discussion as to the effect where such shielding is not in place.\n\nLa Forest J's discussion of vicarious liability has influenced subsequent Supreme Court decisions on that doctrine, most notably Bazley v Curry, which has had significant influence in the jurisprudence of other Commonwealth jurisdictions including the UK House of Lords in its ruling in.",

  "Devil Summoner\n\nDevil Summoner, initially marketed as Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner, is a video game franchise developed and primarily published by Atlus. Focused on a series of role-playing video games, Devil Summoner is a spin-off from Atlus' Megami Tensei franchise. The first entry in the series, Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner, was released in 1995 for the Sega Saturn. The series has seen several more games since, with the most recent main entry being Soul Hackers 2 released in 2022.\n\nDevil Summoner began as a spin-off based on the positively-received Shin Megami Tensei If... (1994). The games, set on an alternate Earth between the 1930s and a fictionalized near-future, featuring a person either related to or holding the Kuzunoha family name using demons to investigate cases involving the supernatural. Created by Kouji Okada, the series was developed by multiple Megami Tensei veterans including artist Kazuma Kaneko and composer Shoji Meguro. While each entry has a different story and time period, it shares a universe and uses recurrent detective story elements.\n\nThe series remained exclusive to Japan until the release of Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. the Soulless Army in 2006, with all games apart from the original receiving English localizations from Atlus USA. Several entries have been supported by spin-off media and supplementary game materials. The first two Devil Summoner titles were among the best-selling titles for the Saturn. Games in the series have seen generally positive reception internationally.\n\nRelated media\n\nThe characters and art of the original Devil Summoner were used for the mobile pinball game Shin Megami Tensei Pinball: Judgement, released in Japan in 2006 through EZweb. Soul Hackers saw two mobile follow-ups in 2008 through EZweb: Devil Summoner: Soul Hackers Intruder, a tactical role-playing with adventure game elements; and Devil Summoner: Soul Hackers New Generation, a turn-based game set in a virtual world.\n\nDevil Summoner was adapted into a live-action television series in 1997, with its popularity prompting a second series in 1998. Two novels based on the series written by Ryo Suzukaze were published by the Aspect Books imprint of Media Works in 1996. Soul Hackers received two novel spin-offs; Devil Summoner Soul Hackers: Death City Korin by Osamu Makino in April 1998 from Aspect Books, and Devil Summoner Soul Hackers: Nightmare of the Butterfly by Shinya Kasai in May 1999 from Famitsu Bunko. A manga adaptation, written by Fumio Sasahara and illustrated by Kazumi Takasawa, was released in two volumes in March and August 1999 by Kadokawa Shoten.\n\nThe Raidou Kuzunoha duology saw multiple media expansions. A spin-off novel called Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. the Dead Messengers, written by Boogey Toumon and illustrated by Kazuma Kaneko, was released by Kadokawa Shoten in 2006. A spin-off manga Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. Kodoku no Marebito, began serialization through the online Famitsu Comic Clear in 2009, being released in six volumes between 2010 and 2012. The manga was written by Kirihito Ayamura based on a story draft by Kaneko, and supervised by Atlus's Kazuyuki Yamai. A two-part CD drama, Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. the One-Eyed God, was released by Frontier Works during 2009.\n\nRecurring elements\n\nRather than the post-apocalyptic setting of the main Megami Tensei series, Devil Summoner takes place in an alternate modern Earth where people known as devil summoners form contracts with demons using devices called COMPs. The protagonists, devil summoners often associated with the Kuzuhona family, investigate misuse of demons. A recurring element is two rival summoner clans, the benevolent Yatagarasu and the malevolent Phantom Society. The Raidou Kuzunoha duology take place in a fictionalized version of Japan's Taish\u014d period. The storylines follow the fourteenth trained devil summoner to take on the title of Raidou Kuzunoha, facing supernatural threats in Tokyo while working at the Narumi Detective Agency.\n\nThe first two titles use a traditional turn-based battle system taken from the main Megami Tensei series, with the player character and a team of up to five demons taking part in battles from a first-person perspective while navigating both an overworld map and dungeons. Soul Hackers 2 again uses a turn-based battle system, taking elements of exploiting enemy weaknesses for extra turns from the main Shin Megami Tensei series. The Raidou Kuzunoha duology shifts to an action-based battle system, navigating pre-rendered town and dungeon environments. The protagonist fights in separate battle arenas with two assigned demons through random encounters, with Kuzuhona capturing demons during battles in the first game, and persuading them to join him through a conversation system in the second. An assigned demon can also be used to solve environmental puzzles.\n\nA recurring element is the player's relationship with their demons. While demons are acquired in different ways across the games, a demon's alignment and actions in battle are all play a role in how they respond to commands. If a demon uses a skill they have low affinity for too many times, they will not respond as well to commands. Recruited demons can also be fused into new demons, carrying over particular traits from their predecessors. A resource called Magnatite or its equivalent is needed to keep demons summoned or powers different elements of attacks appears in multiple entries. A recurring character throughout the series is Dr Victor, a person who takes charge of demon fusion and takes on different appearances throughout the series.\n\nHistory and development\n\nFollowing the success of the Megami Tensei spin-off Shin Megami Tensei If... in 1994, lead developer Kouji Okada decided to create spin-off series to explore different narrative possibilities; the two initial spin-off titles were Revelations: Persona (1996) for the PlayStation, and Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner for the Saturn. Devil Summoner drew on themes from detective fiction, particularly the melancholic and hardboiled fiction of Raymond Chandler. It was the first Megami Tensei title to be released on a 32-bit fifth-generation home video game console, and the first Megami Tensei game to feature 3D graphics. The staff included Okada as director, recurring writer Ryutaro Ito, and artist Kazuma Kaneko. Following the success of Devil Summoner, development of a sequel moved forward, drawing inspiration from the potential dangers of the internet. Okada and Kaneko returned to their respective roles, while Shogo Isogai created the scenario based on Kaneko's draft.\n\nFollowing the release of Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne in 2003, producer Kazuyuki Yamai wanted a project for his team that would offer new challenges, deciding to make a new Devil Summoner title based on staff feedback. Kaneko returned as character designer. A sequel was produced shortly afterwards, continuing Raidou Kuzunoha's story while being a standalone entry for newcomers, with Kaneko returning as both character designer and producer. It saw mechanical improvements and additions taken from the main series. A sequel to Soul Hackers was long requested by fans, though the original game was growing in age and losing mainstream recognition. Eiji Ishida and Mitsuru Hirata, who had previously worked on multiple entries in the Megami Tensei series, began production on a sequel with reworked mechanics and a new art style led by Shirow Miwa.\n\nWhile a release overseas was rumored at the time of its release, the original Devil Summoner remains exclusive to Japan, with its age compared to other titles keeping it from being released during the PS2 era. Soul Hackers was originally also exclusive to Japan, with an overseas release only coming with the 3DS port. The localization was created by Atlus USA, with their focus being on emulating its time period through slang and references to cyberpunk fiction. The two Raidou Kuzunoha titles were the first Devil Summoner titles to be released in the West. For the localization of the first Raidou Kuzunoha, project leader Yu Namba incorporated slang from the 1920s to ground the storyline in that period. The second Raidou Kuzunoha saw a limited release in North America. Only three games have been released in Europe through third-party publishers: Soul Hackers by NIS America, the original Raidou Kuzunoha by Koei, and Soul Hackers 2 by Sega.\n\nMusic\n\nThe original game's music was composed by Toshiko Tasaki and Tsukasa Masuko, with several tracks being repurposed during production or switching role. For Soul Hackers, Tasaki and Masuko were joined by Shoji Meguro; Meguro focused on the game's cyberpunk themes and atmosphere, lamenting his lack of creative freedom compared to his work on Maken X. Meguro returned for the Raidou Kuzunoha duology, using brass and jazz instrumentation to emulate the 1920s alongside his signature guitar-heavy \"Mega",

  "Diggin' in the Crates Crew\n\nThe Diggin' in the Crates Crew, also known as D.I.T.C., is an American hip hop collective formed in 1992 in New York City. The collective's name derives from the act of seeking out records to sample for production. The collective is composed of Lord Finesse, Diamond D, Big L, O.C., Fat Joe, Buckwild, Showbiz and A.G., DJ O.Gee and The Ghetto Dwellas. Its members have achieved substantial and consistent recognition in underground rap circles, having often collaborated with undiscovered talents and underground hip hop artists alongside the most commercial of rappers.\n\nBackground and formation\n\nLord Finesse (born Robert Hall) is a rapper-turned-producer who has produced tracks for The Notorious B.I.G. (1994's Ready to Die) and Dr. Dre (1999's 2001). As a young MC, he would travel to any borough in New York to battle their best rapper and win. He shopped his demo to various record labels and eventually dropped the first of several records, 1990's Funky Technician. The record had a few tracks produced by his longtime friend Diamond (formerly Diamond D), a former member of the rap group Ultimate Force. In the mid-'80s, he was turntable scratching at late-night park parties, often competing with area top DJs (with future cohort Showbiz, being one of his rivals). In 1992, this DJ, then a producer, showcased New York City's underground talent and his rap skills on his classic debut Stunts, Blunts & Hip-Hop.\n\nBronx-native Fat Joe became the first Latino rapper in New York to secure a solo deal with a major label with his 1993 debut Representin'. In 1998, his Don Cartagena release went gold (500,000 copies sold). Showbiz & A.G. were the first to adopt the do-it-yourself attitude by releasing their 1992 debut EP, Can I Get a Soul Clap, practically out of the trunk of their cars. Showbiz, a name he'd stolen from an old Richard Pryor record, pioneered taking an instrumental and looping voices over it. His partner A.G. was known as the Bronx's \"punchline\" rapper. Through the mid-'90s, he was a prolific producer, producing tracks for primarily underground rap acts. In 1999, A.G. restarted his rap career with his solo CD Dirty Version.\n\nMeanwhile, another Bronx native named Buckwild, who once started out as Lord Finesse's apprentice in his production company, started producing tracks around 1994. He first gained major recognition in the underground rap scene for producing tracks for O.C.'s Word... Life in 1994. He went on to produce for several prominent rappers, including Fat Joe, The Notorious B.I.G., Big L and Big Pun. After the release of Word... Life, O.C. made numerous guest appearances on other D.I.T.C. members' records while maintaining a low profile. One of the less prolific members of the group, DJ O.Gee, contributed production to his frequent collaborator O.C.'s Word... Life, Jewelz, and Hidden Gems, as well as the track \"Your Life\" for Soul In The Hole (Soundtrack). DJ O.Gee also produced \"Laughing At You\" from Big Pun's 2000 album Yeeeah Baby, contributed scratches to Buckwild's remix of Channel Live's song \"Mad Izm\" on the 2007 compilation Buckwild: Diggin In The Crates, and contributed a remix to the 2014 D.I.T.C.: The Remix Project. The third member of D.I.T.C. was Big L, a gangsta rapper from Harlem. Staying true to hardcore hip hop and calling himself the \"flamboyant MC\", he issued his 1995 debut Lifestylez ov da Poor and Dangerous on Columbia Records. Big L was working on his second album, due for release on Rawkus Records, when he was murdered on February 15, 1999 at age 24. The remaining D.I.T.C. members came together later that year for a memorial concert at Trammps in New York (anthologized by a series of CD releases), and recorded a self-titled group record in 2000.\n\nLater years\n\nOn December 4, 2008, D.I.T.C. member Party Arty unexpectedly died of unspecified health complications, aged 31. In 2008, Freddie Foxxx (using his Bumpy Knuckles pseudonym) released the long-shelved Crazy Like A Foxxx album. The second of two discs featured DITC produced demo versions of the original tracks dating to 1993. DITC production contrasted with the Jailhouse version of production from 1994.\n\nIn 2011, Showbiz stated that the crew itself is now defunct and will no longer create any new albums in the future citing musical creative differences.

  "Kilcrea Castle\n\nKilcrea Castle is a ruined 15th-century towerhouse and bawn located near the Kilcrea Friary, west of Cork City, Ireland. The tower house and friary were both built by Cormac Laidir MacCarthy, 9th Lord of Muskerry.\n\nLocation\n\nKillcrea Castle stands in a copse, which almost hides it, in the valley of the River Bride on its right (southern) bank. This River Bride is a right-hand tributary of the River Lee (not the River Bride that flows into the Munster Blackwater).\n\nKilcrea Friary is nearby to the east, on the same side of the river. Ovens is the nearest village. It is between Cork City and Macroom.\n\nHistory and construction\n\nThe castle was completed by 1465 by Cormac Laidir MacCarthy, 9th Lord of Muskerry and founder of Kilcrea Friary, in a marshy area over an old fort possibly dating to the Bronze Age.\n\nThe overall structure was built facing north (towards the River Bride), with the main five-story tower house on the western side and the bawn on the eastern side towards the friary. The remains of a three-story tower anchor the southeast corner of the bawn. Text from the 1840s state that the bawn was enclosed with two square towers, however any physical evidence of a second tower on the bawn is lost to the undergrowth.\n\nIn the mid-19th century a cutting of the now disused Cork and Macroom Railway line was built through the moat of the castle on the northern side.\n\nOwnership\n\nUnlike the friary, which is in state ownership and is maintained by the National Monuments Service of Ireland, the ruins are on privately owned lands, the land immediate to, and including the ruins themselves, currently serving as a cattle farm. The castle is listed as a protected structure by Cork County Council.",

  "Camp Bethel\n\nCamp Bethel is a historic Christian camp meeting facility at 124 Camp Bethel Road, overlooking the Connecticut River in Haddam, Connecticut. Founded in 1877, Camp Bethel is one of the few surviving camp meeting sites left in New England. It is owned by the Camp Bethel Association (CBA), a non-denominational, evangelical organization and is open to rent. The camp was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2007.\n\nDescription and history\n\nCamp Bethel is located in southeastern Haddam, just north of the East Haddam Bridge over the Connecticut River. It is accessed via Camp Bethel Road, which runs north from Connecticut Route 82. It is located on a bluff overlooking the Connecticut River, surrounded by woods. The main facilities of the camp include a chapel, memorial hall, boarding houses, and a dining hall, as well as more than 40 cabins. Most of these facilities were built between 1889 and about 1920; the dining hall is the notable exception, built in 1992 after the old dining hall burned down.\n\nThe camp was established in 1877 by the Life and Advent Union, a division of Seventh Day Adventism which split in 1863 (at an Adventist revival camp in Wilbraham, Massachusetts). Functioning mainly at other Adventist camps throughout New England, they located this site as a permanent base on land leased from a local farmer named Clark. It was the third revival camp established in the state, and the first known to be for an Adventist denomination. As with most camps, early revivals were held in temporary structures, mainly tents, including large ones for use as dining and worship halls. In 1964 the camp was formally renamed \"Camp Bethel\", and its ownership was converted to a non-denominational not-for-profit organization. It is still used as an organizing center for missionary work; its facilities are sometimes leased to other organizations.",

  "Compact operator on Hilbert space\n\nIn the mathematical discipline of functional analysis, the concept of a compact operator on Hilbert space is an extension of the concept of a matrix acting on a finite-dimensional vector space; in Hilbert space, compact operators are precisely the closure of finite-rank operators (representable by finite-dimensional matrices) in the topology induced by the operator norm. As such, results from matrix theory can sometimes be extended to compact operators using similar arguments. By contrast, the study of general operators on infinite-dimensional spaces often requires a genuinely different approach.\n\nFor example, the spectral theory of compact operators on Banach spaces takes a form that is very similar to the Jordan canonical form of matrices. In the context of Hilbert spaces, a square matrix is unitarily diagonalizable if and only if it is normal. A corresponding result holds for normal compact operators on Hilbert spaces. More generally, the compactness assumption can be dropped. As stated above, the techniques used to prove, e.g., the spectral theorem, are different, involving operator-valued measures on the spectrum.\n\nSome results for compact operators on Hilbert space will be discussed, starting with general properties before considering subclasses of compact operators.\n\nSome general properties\n\nWe list in this section some general properties of compact operators.\n\nIf X and Y are Hilbert spaces (in fact, X Banach and Y normed will suffice), then T : X \u2192 Y is compact if and only if it is continuous when viewed as a map from X with the weak topology to Y (with the norm topology). (See, and note in this reference that the uniform boundedness will apply in the situation where F \u2286 X satisfies (\u2200\u03c6 \u2208 Hom(X, K)) sup{x**(\u03c6) = \u03c6(x) : x} < \u221e, where K is the underlying field. The uniform boundedness principle applies since Hom(X, K) with the norm topology will be a Banach space, and the maps x** : Hom(X,K) \u2192 K are continuous homomorphisms with respect to this topology.)\n\nThe family of compact operators is a norm-closed, two-sided, *-ideal in L(H). Consequently, a compact operator T cannot have a bounded inverse if H is infinite-dimensional. If ST = TS = I, then the identity operator would be compact, a contradiction.\n\nIf sequences of bounded operators Bn \u2192 B, Cn \u2192 C in the strong operator topology and T is compact, then\n\nNotice each Pm is a finite-rank operator. Similar reasoning shows that if T is compact, then T is the uniform limit of some sequence of finite-rank operators.\n\nBy the norm-closedness of the ideal of compact operators, the converse is also true.\n\nThe quotient C*-algebra of L(H) modulo the compact operators is called the Calkin algebra, in which one can consider properties of an operator up to compact perturbation.\n\nCompact self-adjoint operator\n\nA bounded operator T on a Hilbert space H is said to be self-adjoint if T = T*, or equivalently,\n\nIt follows that \u27e8Tx, x\u27e9 is real for every x \u2208 H, thus eigenvalues of T, when they exist, are real. When a closed linear subspace L of H is invariant under T, then the restriction of T to L is a self-adjoint operator on L, and furthermore, the orthogonal complement L\u22a5 of L is also invariant under T. For example, the space H can be decomposed as the orthogonal direct sum of two T&ndash;invariant closed linear subspaces: the kernel of T, and the orthogonal complement\n\n(ker T)\u22a5\n\nof the kernel (which is equal to the closure of the range of T, for any bounded self-adjoint operator). These basic facts play an important role in the proof of the spectral theorem below.\n\nThe classification result for Hermitian\n\nn \u00d7 n\n\nmatrices is the spectral theorem: If M = M*, then M is unitarily diagonalizable, and the diagonalization of M has real entries. Let T be a compact self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space H. We will prove the same statement for T: the operator T can be diagonalized by an orthonormal set of eigenvectors, each of which corresponds to a real eigenvalue.\n\nSpectral theorem\n\nTheorem For every compact self-adjoint operator T on a real or complex Hilbert space H, there exists an orthonormal basis of H consisting of eigenvectors of T. More specifically, the orthogonal complement of the kernel of T admits either a finite orthonormal basis of eigenvectors of T, or a countably infinite orthonormal basis {en} of eigenvectors of T, with corresponding eigenvalues\n\n{\u03bbn} \u2282 R\n\n, such that\n\n\u03bbn \u2192 0\n\n.\n\nIn other words, a compact self-adjoint operator can be unitarily diagonalized. This is the spectral theorem.\n\nWhen H is separable, one can mix the basis {en} with a countable orthonormal basis for the kernel of T, and obtain an orthonormal basis {fn} for H, consisting of eigenvectors of T with real eigenvalues {\u03bcn} such that\n\n\u03bcn \u2192 0\n\n.\n\nCorollary For every compact self-adjoint operator T on a real or complex separable infinite-dimensional Hilbert space H, there exists a countably infinite orthonormal basis {fn} of H consisting of eigenvectors of T, with corresponding eigenvalues\n\n{\u03bcn} \u2282 R\n\n, such that\n\n\u03bcn \u2192 0\n\n.\n\nThe idea\n\nLet us discuss first the finite-dimensional proof. It proves the spectral theorem for a Hermitian n \u00d7 n matrix T hinges on showing the existence of one eigenvector x. Once this is done, Hermiticity implies that both the linear span and orthogonal complement of x (of dimension n-1) are invariant subspaces of T. The desired result is then obtained by induction for\n\nBut z is arbitrary, therefore\n\nTy \u2212 my = 0\n\n. This is the crux of proof for spectral theorem in the matricial case.\n\nNote that while the Lagrange multipliers generalize to the infinite-dimensional case, the compactness of the unit sphere is lost. This is where the assumption that the operator T be compact is useful.\n\nDetails\n\nClaim If T is a compact self-adjoint operator on a non-zero Hilbert space H and which in turn implies that y also maximizes the Rayleigh quotient g(x) (see above). This shows that y is an eigenvector of T, and ends the proof of the claim.\n\nNote. The compactness of T is crucial. In general, f need not be continuous for the weak topology on the unit ball B. For example, let T be the identity operator, which is not compact when H is infinite-dimensional. Take any orthonormal sequence {yn}. Then yn converges to 0 weakly, but lim f(yn) = 1 \u2260 0 = f(0).\n\nLet T be a compact operator on a Hilbert space H. A finite (possibly empty) or countably infinite orthonormal sequence {en} of eigenvectors of T, with corresponding non-zero eigenvalues, is constructed by induction as follows. Let H0 = H and T0 = T. If m(T0) = 0, then T = 0 and the construction stops without producing any eigenvector en. Suppose that orthonormal eigenvectors\n\ne0,..., en \u2212 1\n\nof T have been found. Then\n\nEn := span(e0,..., en \u2212 1)\n\nis invariant under T, and by self-adjointness, the orthogonal complement Hn of En is an invariant subspace of T. Let Tn denote the restriction of T to Hn. If m(Tn) = 0, then Tn = 0, and the construction stops. Otherwise, by the claim applied to Tn, there is a norm one eigenvector en of T in Hn, with corresponding non-zero eigenvalue \u03bbn =\n\n\u00b1 m(Tn)\n\n.\n\nLet F = (span{en})\u22a5, where {en} is the finite or infinite sequence constructed by the inductive process; by self-adjointness, F is invariant under T. Let S denote the restriction of T to F. If the process was stopped after finitely many steps, with the last vector em\u22121, then F= Hm and S = Tm = 0 by construction. In the infinite case, compactness of T and the weak-convergence of en to 0 imply that\n\nTen = \u03bbnen \u2192 0\n\n, therefore\n\n\u03bbn \u2192 0\n\n. Since F is contained in Hn for every n, it follows that m(S) \u2264 m({Tn}) = |\u03bbn| for every n, hence m(S) = 0. This implies again that\n\nS = 0\n\n.\n\nThe fact that S = 0 means that F is contained in the kernel of T. Conversely, if x \u2208 ker(T) then by self-adjointness, x is orthogonal to every eigenvector {en} with non-zero eigenvalue. It follows that\n\nF = ker(T)\n\n, and that {en} is an orthonormal basis for the orthogonal complement of the kernel of T. One can complete the diagonalization of T by selecting an orthonormal basis of the kernel. This proves the spectral theorem.\n\nA shorter but more abstract proof goes as follows: by Zorn's lemma, select U to be a maximal subset of H with the following three properties: all elements of U are eigenvectors of T, they have norm one, and any two distinct elements",
  "Dispersal of invasive species by ballast water\n\nThe dispersal of invasive species by ballast water refers to the unintentional introduction of invasive species to new habitats via the ballast water carried by commercial shipping vessels. Ballast water spreads an estimated 7000 living species to new habitats across the globe. These species can affect the ecological balance of their new regions by outcompeting native species or otherwise impacting native ecosystems.\n\nBallast water\n\nThe purpose of ballast water is to provide transverse stability, improve propulsion and maneuverability, and to compensate for weight loss due to fuel and water consumption. Approximately 10 billion tons of ballast water is transported each year, accounting for 90% of our world trade. Typically, ballast water discharge contains a variety of biological materials including non-native, invasive, and exotic species that can cause extensive ecological and economic damage to aquatic ecosystems.\n\nThroughout this process, large ships withdraw up to 20 million gallons of water at their specific loading ports. Including native species; both plant and animal, before disposing them at their next destination. However, when these invasive species are unloaded, specific conditions like temperature, salinity, lack of resources, and predator-to-prey competition affects how foreign species survive in non-native habitats. These factors cause stress within the ecosystems, throwing off ecological and environmental balance.\n\nAs new species are introduced to non-native ecosystems, interspecific competition often becomes more intense. If native species are outcompeted by invasive species, it can affect the established predator-prey relationships within that region, possibly having disruptive effects on the wider food web.\n\nFreshwater zebra mussel\n\nDreissena polymorpha, commonly known as the zebra mussel, live in freshwater and are native to southern lakes in Russia and Ukraine. The zebra mussel has become an invasive species that is frequently spread via ballast water. In North America, Great Britain, Ireland, Italy, Spain, and Sweden, the species has invaded native habitats. The mussels take oxygen and food from the water, limiting the resources available for native species and disrupting local ecosystems. Zebra mussels can have a significant impact on algae in the habitats they invade. Invasive zebra mussels, often in monotypic populations, have been shown to damage abiotic components found in invaded habitats such as boats, waterways, harbors, water treatment plants, and power plants.\n\nSea walnut\n\nMnemiopsis leidyi, commonly known as the sea walnut, is a ctenophore species in the class Tentaculata. This species is native to the eastern coast of North and South America. Currently, Mnemiopsis leidyi has become invasive through the transfer of ballast water to the Black, Azov, Aegean and Marmara Seas, west coast of Sweden, and the Southern and Northern Baltic Sea. This carnivorous species feeds on zooplankton, crustaceans, fish eggs and larvae. Some individuals are known to consume individuals of their own species. Specifically, Mnemiopsis sp. has become an ecological problem for local fisheries because they have been linked to the diminishing zooplankton population.\n\nGreen crab\n\nCarcinus maenas, commonly known as the green crab, is native to the Baltic Sea and the northeastern Atlantic Ocean. This species has become invasive to North America, South Africa, South America, Asia, and Australia. This widely spread invasive species is often distributed by ship ballast water. C. maenas is a voracious predator to many species such as worms, mollusks, oysters, and clams. The competitiveness and efficiency of this species out-competes native crabs and lobsters. Specifically, the green crab disrupts eelgrass beds, often home to diverse fish populations. For aquaculture and fishing industries, C. maenas poses a particular threat due to its appetite for valuable farmed mollusks.",

  "HMS Sharpshooter (1917)\n\nHMS Sharpshooter was an destroyer which served with the Royal Navy during World War I. Launched on 27 February 1917, the ship joined the Harwich Force, undertaking convoy escort duties. The vessel also took part in the Navy\u2019s bombardment of Ostend later that year. On 1 June 1918, the destroyer rescued Captain A. C. Sharwood, one of the first pilots of the Royal Australian Navy, who ditched his Sopwith 2F.1 Camel nearby. After the war, Sharpshooter joined the Navy gunnery training establishment at Plymouth, but did not stay long and was reduced to Reduced Complement on 5 March 1919. The Royal Navy was rationalising its destroyer force and Sharpshooter, deemed superfluous, was sold to be broken up on 29 April 1927.\n\nDesign and development\n\nSharpshooter was one of ten destroyers ordered by the British Admiralty in December 1915 as part of the Seventh War Construction Programme. The design was based on the preceding and differed primarily in utilising geared steam turbines to improve fuel consumption.\n\nSharpshooter was 276 ft long overall, with a beam of 26 ft and a draught of 9 ft. Displacement was approximately 1065 LT normal. Power was provided by three Yarrow boilers feeding two Parsons geared steam turbines rated at 27000 shp and driving two shafts, to give a design speed of 36 kn. Three funnels were fitted. A total of 296 LT of fuel oil was carried, giving a design range of 3450 nmi at 15 kn.\n\nArmament consisted of three QF 4in Mk IV guns on the ship's centreline, with one on the forecastle, one aft on a raised platform and one between the second and third funnels. A single 2-pounder (40 mm) pom-pom anti-aircraft gun was carried, while torpedo armament consisted of two twin mounts for 21 in torpedoes. The ship had a complement of 82 officers and ratings.\n\nConstruction and career\n\nSharpshooter was laid down at the William Beardmore and Company shipyard in Dalmuir during May 1916 with the yard number 550 at a contract price of \u00a3170,722. The vessel was launched in December 1916 and completed in February 1917.\n\nOn commissioning, Sharpshooter joined the 10th Destroyer Flotilla of the Harwich Force. The destroyer was engaged in escort duties and, on 9 April, was accompanying a convoy travelling east from the Netherlands when it was attacked by the German submarine. The submarine successfully sank one of the merchant ships, but before it could unleash another torpedo, Sharpshooter saw the track made by the wake and, following it, rushed upon the submarine, dropping three depth charges and scaring it away.\n\nOn 4 June 1917, Sharpshooter was deployed as part of a large group of seven cruisers and twenty-five destroyers to protect the monitors and  in their bombardment of the German held Belgian port of Ostend. At 2:30 in the morning of 5 June, the destroyer was part of a flotilla of four cruisers and nine destroyers that were patrolling off Thornton Bank when they spotted the German destroyers S15 and S20. A vigorous battle ensued, during which a torpedo narrowly missed Sharpshooter, passing astern. Along with, and, Sharpshooter damaged S15 and sank S20. The flotilla subsequently undertook anti-submarine patrols, but the destroyer did not sight an enemy boat. The rest of the war was uneventful apart from 1 June 1918 when the destroyer rescued one of the first pilots of the Royal Australian Navy, Captain A. C. Sharwood, who ditched his Sopwith 2F.1 Camel, operated from, nearby.\n\nSharpshooter remained part of the 10th Destroyer Flotilla at the end of the war. After the conflict, the ship was transferred to the Gunnery School at Portsmouth and, on 5 March 1919, was reduced to Reduced Complement. In 1923, the Navy decided to scrap many of the older destroyers in preparation for the introduction of newer and larger vessels. Sharpshooter was sold for scrap to Thos. W. Ward at Briton Ferry on 29 April 1927.",

  "Young Humanists International\n\nYoung Humanists International, known as the International Humanist and Ethical Youth Organisation or IHEYO from 2002\u20132019, is the youth wing of Humanists International (known as the International Humanist and Ethical Union from 1952\u20132019), founded in 2002. It aims to network young humanists around the world together, support training and promote humanist values for the age category of 18\u201335. It is an umbrella organisation representing around 40,000 young people across the world.\n\nPurpose\n\nYoung Humanists International is the international umbrella organisation for Humanist youth organisations. Its primary mission is to bring into active association youth groups and young humanist individuals throughout the world interested in promoting humanism, as is described in the IHEU Amsterdam Declaration 2002. Young Humanists International brings together people aged 18\u201335 who describe themselves as humanists, atheists, agnostics, freethinkers, skeptics and similar views.\n\nThe vision of Young Humanists International is to give a voice to young humanists within the mission of Humanists International. The mission of Humanists International is to build and represent the global humanist movement that defends human rights and promotes humanist values worldwide. It does this by organising international networking events, offering training, connecting youth through social media and by its work in regional working groups. These activities empower its members to achieve their individual, local and regional goals.\n\nYoung Humanists International members form the young humanist communities and campaign for political and cultural change in a diverse range of areas such as religious freedom, women's rights, education rights, abortion rights, LGBTIQ rights, equality, human rights, freedom of speech/thought/belief, public communication of science.\n\nHistory\n\nYoung Humanists International was formally established as the International Humanist and Ethical Youth Organisation (IHEYO) in 2003, but it was not completely a 21st-century construct. The first version of the organisation was launched in 1966, and lasted around ten years. In the 1980s, it was again revived for a similar period of time. But it was not until 2001, when Humanists International (then known as the International Humanist and Ethical Union) started an internship programme that the idea of re-establishing an international humanist youth network was revived in a lasting way. IHEYO was renamed Young Humanists International on 15 February 2019.\n\nMembership\n\nAs IHEYO, the organisation kept a separate membership list from its parent organisation, the International Humanist and Ethical Union. At the 2017 general assembly in Malta, the organisation voted to merge its membership list with the parent organisation as part of the relaunched Humanists International and Young Humanists International.\n\nIt is customary for organisations with youth sections to have those sections represented as voting delegates at Young Humanists International meetings. For example, the Belgian humanist group DeMens.nu is represented by Humanistische Jongeren; the American Ethical Union is represented in the form of its Future Ethical of Societies wing; and the British group Humanists UK is represented by Young Humanists (UK) and Humanist Students.\n\nStructure\n\nYoung Humanists International is organised into regional \"working groups\", which act as forums through which youth-led humanist organisations can cooperate and coordinate their activities. There are four Working Groups: the Asian Humanist Alliance, African Working Group, European Working Group, and an Americas Working Group.\n\nAfrican Working Group\n\nThe African Working Group was established around 2005. It organises regional meetings in East and West Africa. The African Working Group is mainly organised in East Africa (Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya, Rwanda, etc.) and West Africa (Nigeria, Ghana, Liberia, Cameroon, etc.). The Fourth Annual IHEYO East African Regional Working Group Meeting was held in Kigali on 26\u201328 August 2015.\n\nAmericas Working Group\n\nThe American Working group is the newest and launched in Washington DC in May 2015 at the Future of Ethical Societies Annual conference. This working group covers Canada, the United States of America, Central America, and South America.\n\nAsian Humanist Alliance (Asian Working Group)\n\nThe Asian Working Group is a joint humanist effort in this continent to foster humanist values and ideas. Since its inception in 2007, it has published information \u2212bulletins, has had regular meetings and organised events. The Working Group has members in Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and the Philippines.\n\nEuropean Working Group\n\nThe European Working group brings together member organisations in Europe. Humanist groups in Western Europe are typically among the strongest and best-developed in the world, and Working Group participation is often led by dedicated youth sections of European humanist organisations. The Working Group organises annual in-person meetings to coordinate the international exchanges taking place at events organised in Europe, including conferences it organises such as \"European Humanist Youth Days\".\n\nBetter Tomorrow\n\nBetter Tomorrow is IHEYO's annual charity event. Its concept was based on the British student federation AHS's Non-Prophet Week.",
  "Corporate Responsibility Group\n\nThe Corporate Responsibility Group (CRG) was a training and development network for corporate responsibility (CR) and sustainability practitioners in the United Kingdom. Founded in 1987, it was succeeded in January 2015 by spin-off Institute of Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability (ICRS).\n\nHistory and governance\n\nThe group was founded in 1987, as a not-for-profit organisation run by a volunteer board of corporate responsibility practitioners.\n\nThe Institute of Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability was created by CRG in 2014 to respond to the need for an organisation that supports the personal and professional development of individuals in CR, sustainability or related functions.\n\nRepresenting the profession\n\nCRG undertakes research every few years on the state of its profession. Its 2009 study found that 84% of corporate responsibility professionals considered the discipline to be a mainstream business issue, compared to 72% in 2006 survey.\n\nIn 2011 the group announced that it would create a professional body for individual corporate responsibility practitioners in the UK, distinct from the group's current organisation-membership model.\n\nResearch\n\nThe group has collaborated with academia and government to produce research into the state of corporate responsibility. From 2002 to 2003 it supported the work of a UK government working group, commissioned by Stephen Timms MP, the then Minister of State for e-Commerce & Competitiveness at the Department of Trade and Industry (now BIS), looking at professional skills development in the corporate responsibility sector. Its report, \"Changing Manager Mindsets\", was published in 2003 in conjunction with Ashridge Business School. In 2005 it produced a study with Ashridge Business School on the state of executive development amongst corporate responsibility professionals. In 2007, a report published by the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University and Cranfield School of Management reported that the \"professionalisation of the corporate responsibility and sustainability function in many companies... has also been supported by organisations such as CRG\".\n\nPartnerships\n\nThe group has an established link with Business in the Community (BITC). By convention, the Chair of CRG sits on the Board of Directors of BITC. BITC's \"Key Knowledge for CR Practitioners\" primer cites CRG's Code of Conduct for CR practitioners under \"Key Principles & Frameworks\".\n\nThe Doughty Centre for Corporate Responsibility, at the Cranfield School of Management cites the group as a partner.\n\nMembership\n\nMembership is vetted, and comprises over 300 corporate responsibility professionals, representing approximately 85 organisations. Membership covers those within member organisations in the private, public, and third sector, though consultants are not admitted. Among the members - many of which employ members of CRG's volunteer board - are Accenture, British American Tobacco, City of London Corporation, The Crown Estate, Herbert Smith Freehills, IBM, Linklaters, Olswang, QinetiQ, RWE npower, Tata Consultancy Services, Thomson Reuters, Wragge & Co and Zoological Society of London.\n\nEvents\n\nThe group runs frequent members-only events, including clinics; masterclasses and networking.

  "Notice of proposed rulemaking\n\nA notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) is a public notice that is issued by law when an independent agency of the US government wishes to add, remove, or change a rule or regulation as part of the rulemaking process. The notice is an important part of US administrative law, which facilitates government by typically creating a process of taking of public comment. The term is also used at the state level in the United States.\n\nProcedure\n\nAlthough it is not required by the US Constitution, NPRM is required and defined by the Administrative Procedure Act, section 553. The US Congress created the requirement to enlighten agencies and to force them to listen to comments and concerns of people who will likely be affected by the regulation. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Federal Communications Commission (FCC), National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are examples of agencies subject to the NPRM.\n\nThe NPRM is published in the Federal Register and typically gives 60 days for public comment from any interested party and an additional 30 days for reply comments. Original comments may still be filed in the reply comments window. While that is the normal method of agency rulemaking, emergency rulemaking may bypass the NPRM process. A notice is not required to be published in the Federal Register if all persons subject to it are named and personally served with a copy of it.\n\nEach notice, whether published in the Federal Register or personally served, includes:\n\nNPRMs are often preceded by a notice of inquiry (NOI) in which comments are invited but no rules have yet been proposed. Comments received in that period allow the agency to prepare the NPRM better by making more-informed decisions on proposals. An NPRM may be followed by a further notice of proposed rulemaking (FNPRM), if the comments from the initial NPRM lead the agency to change the proposal drastically to the point that further comment is required. Rules are finalized when a report and order (R&O) is issued, which may be amended with a second R&O (or more) in a continuing proceeding (such as the DTV transition).\n\nRegulations.gov is a website established in 2002 to provide better access to rulemaking and allows comments to be posted to nearly 300 federal agencies.\n\nForeign equivalents\n\nEquivalent procedures of public consultation are also used outside the United States for a document giving public notice of a proposed rule change and inviting informed comment on it. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) publishes similar notices referred to a notice of proposed amendment when it seeks public comment.",

  "Rescuecom Corp. v. Google Inc.\n\nRescuecom Corp. v. Google Inc. 562 F.3d 123 (2nd Cir. 2009), was a United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit case in which the court held that recommending a trademark for keyword advertising was a commercial use of the trademark, and could constitute trademark infringement. The case involved Rescuecom, a computer repair and support company, and Google, a web search and advertising company. Prior to the case's resolution, Google recommended the 'Rescuecom' trademark to businesses (including Rescuecom's competitors), that were buying keywords through Google's AdWords product.\n\nThe case was first heard by the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York in 2006. The court ruled in favor of Google and held that Google's use of the Rescuecom trademark did not constitute a \"use\" under the Lanham Act. As a result, Rescuecom's claims of infringement did not apply. The Second Circuit vacated this ruling in 2009, ruling that Google's actions constituted commercial use and that Rescuecom's claims could not be immediately dismissed. The case was sent back to the district court for reconsideration.\n\nKeyword advertising case law\n\nThe use of trademarks in the United States is governed by the Lanham Act (Title 15, Article 22 of the United States Code). Prior case law in the area of keyword-triggered trademark use consisted at the time of a series of cases involving WhenU (heard by district courts outside the Second Circuit), as well as 1-800 CONTACTS, INC. v. WhenU. com, Inc., a case heard by the Second Circuit appeals court. Both the district and appeals court in Rescuecom discuss these cases extensively.\n\nThe WhenU cases\n\nWhenU, an advertising company developed a piece of advertising software called Save Now. When installed on a user's computer, Save Now would respond to a user's actions by generating pop-up advertisements. In particular, when a user browsed to a URL that WhenU possessed advertisements for, WhenU would open a window showing advertisements. Cases were filed against WhenU in 2003 by plaintiffs whose sites were found in WhenU's index. District Courts within the Sixth and Fourth Circuits ruled that WhenU's use of the plaintiff's trademarked URLs did not constitute a use of the plaintiff's trademarks because this use was restricted to the operation of WhenU's software.\n\nThe Second Circuit in 1-800 Contacts v. WhenU.com Inc. upheld the above line of reasoning, holding that usage of a trademark in an \"unpublished directory of terms\" and the appearance of \"separate, branded ads\" triggered by a trademark do not constitute \"use\" of the trademark as per the Lanham Act. This decision is noteworthy for discussion of Rescuecom due to stare decisis and the binding precedent established by an appellate court.\n\nComplaint\n\nAdWords is a system used by Google through which advertisers can purchase keywords. When a user searches for a purchased keyword, Google displays the advertiser's ad and link. Google also provides advertisers a \"Keyword Suggestion Tool\", a system that recommends additional keywords for an advertiser to purchase. Prior to Rescuecom litigation, Google recommended trademarks, and in particular, the Rescuecom trademark to advertisers.\n\nRescuecom therefore filed suit against Google on six counts: (1) that Google infringed on the Rescuecom trademark, (2) that Google's use causes \"false designation of origin\", (3) federal dilution, (4) common law trademark infringement, (5) state law dilution claim, and (6) tortious interference with economic advantage.\n\nProcedural history\n\nThe district court drew heavily from the Second Circuit's decision in 1-800 and granted Google's motion to dismiss Rescuecom's claims. The court held that Rescuecom had \"prove[d] no facts in support of its claim... [of] trademark use\". Given that a trademark \"use\" is required under the Lanham Act for infringement to occur, the district court dismissed Rescuecom's first three claims. The last three counts at issue were viewed by the court as issues of state law. Although the district court had jurisdiction to consider those claims under, it declined to exercise these claims as it had already dismissed Rescuecom's federal law claims.\n\nOpinion of the Court\n\nThe Second Circuit vacated the district court's decision, holding that Google's use of the \"Rescuecom\" trademark constituted a \"use in commerce\" under the Lanham Act.\n\nThe court noted this case as distinct from 1-800, rejecting the argument advanced by Google and accepted by a number of district courts in the Second Circuit, that the inclusion of a trademark in an internal computer directory cannot constitute trademark use. The court proceeds to distinguish that Google had made direct use of the 'Rescuecom' trademark, whereas WhenU did not make direct use of the '1-800 Contacts' trademark (instead it displayed ads that were triggered by the plaintiff's mark):\n\n\"Google\u2019s recommendation and sale of Rescuecom\u2019s mark to its advertising customers are not internal uses. Furthermore, 1-800 did not imply that use of a trademark in a software program\u2019s internal directory precludes a finding of trademark use. Rather, influenced by the fact that the defendant was not using the plaintiff\u2019s trademark at all... If we were to adopt Google and its amici\u2019s argument, the operators of search engines would be free to use trademarks in ways designed to deceive and cause consumer confusion.  This is surely neither within the intention nor the letter of the Lanham Act.\"\n\nThe court further distinguished the appearance of ads in 1-800 Contacts compared to Rescuecom. In 1-800 Contacts, ads were displayed in a different window and did not affect the end-user's ability to access the plaintiff's website (note that the ads appeared in synchrony with the plaintiff's website). The court accepted Rescuecom's assertion that Google's placement of \"sponsored links\" above organic search results could lead to user confusion as required under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. As a result, Google's argument that a sponsored link is analogous to placement of a generic brand next to a trademarked brand was rejected by the court.\n\nSubsequent developments\n\nIn March 2010, Rescuecom discontinued further proceedings against Google, filing a statement of dismissal and issuing a press release declaring victory in the case. However, Google apparently made no new concessions to Rescuecom to get it to drop the lawsuit; instead, the changes that Rescuecom claimed as victory were made by Google five years earlier.",

  "Ixtl\u00e1n del Rio (archaeological site)\n\nIxtl\u00e1n del Rio is an archaeological site located in the Ixtl\u00e1n del Rio municipality, on the south west region of the Nayarit State, Mexico. It is also known as \"Los Toriles\" and contains the only vestiges of the western cultures in Nayarit.\n\nThe presence of prehispanic vestiges in the form of petroglyphs are registered in five areas, the most important are \"El Terrero\", \"Sayulapa\" and \"El Veladero\", which depict sgraffiti lines and representations of abstract figures, such as spirals with rays.\n\nOf the traditional Shaft Tombs, five large concentration areas are identified, containing human bone remains; domestic pottery ollas, comales and cantaros (pitchers)]; as well as sculpture type remains (human and animal figures).\n\nBackground\n\nIn remote times in which early American settlers crossed the Behring Strait, several sedentary groups migrated south. The territory of present-day Nayarit State has manifestations of those settlers, chronologically and consecutively located in three cultural periods: Los Concheros, the shaft tomb tradition and the Aztatl\u00e1n tradition.\n\nLos Concheros\n\nLos concheros (\"concha\" = shell), is a name given to groups dedicated to the sea exploitation of the ocean shores, and in the process developed the first settlements, with sea shells. According to archaeologist Gabriela Zepeda, the Matanch\u00e9n and San Blas coves, it was in the Nayarit shores where history commenced in these lands. From about 2000 BCE up to 1500 CE, an amazing occupation persisted by a culture that perceived the sea as merciful and stormy God. It was also the origin of artistic ceramic modeling and cooking.\n\nShaft Tomb Tradition\n\nOn the traditional shaft tomb tradition, five major areas of concentration were identified, containing bones; ceramics for domestic use (pots, comales and pitchers); and remains of sculptural type (human and animal figures).\n\nThe Shaft Tomb Tradition (500 BCE - 500 CE) constitutes a peculiar feature of mesoamerican prehispanic development in M\u00e9xico, although there are analog burials forms elsewhere in the continent. Shaft Tombs thus far discovered in the Nayarit territory, were found and excavated outside of the settlement sites of that epoch, in vertical shafts (Wells), with one or two chambers where their dead were placed together with human and animal sculptures, also with large vessels that contained funerary offerings, these reflect the development achieved by this tradition, with the particular regional characteristics found.\n\nThe Western Mexico shaft tomb tradition or shaft tomb culture refers to a set of interlocked cultural traits found in the western Mexican states of Jalisco, Nayarit, and, to a lesser extent, Colima to the south, roughly dating to the period between 300 BCE and 400 CE, although there are disagreements on this end-date. Nearly all of the artifacts associated with this shaft tomb tradition have been discovered by looters and are without provenance, making dating problematic. The first major undisturbed shaft tomb associated with the tradition was not discovered but until 1993, at Huitzilapa, Jalisco.\n\nThe shaft tomb tradition is thought to have developed around 300 BCE. Some shaft tombs predate the tradition by more than 1000 years, for example, the shaft tomb at El Ope\u00f1o in Michoac\u00e1n has been dated to 1500 BCE but it is linked to central, rather than western Mexico. Like much else concerning the tradition, its origins are not well understood, although the valleys around Tequila, Jalisco, which include the archaeological sites of Huitzilapa and Teuchitlan, constitute its \"undisputed core\". The tradition lasted until at least 300 CE although, as noted above, there is disagreement on the end date.\n\nAztatl\u00e1n Tradition\n\nThe archaeological ruins of \"Los Toriles\" are related to the Aztatl\u00e1n tradition. Its buildings contain temples with stairs and worship places made of round stones jointed with clay, stone slabs and in some cases, with motif carved stones including spirals and a snake.\n\nThe Aztatl\u00e1n tradition is chronologically located on a period from 700 BCE throughout 1520 CE, it is considered a western mesoamerican cultural event that shares cultural traits with the Toltec and received cultural influences from central highlands.\n\nThis rich tradition is manifested in their varied and beautiful complex ceramic and polished stone, obsidian, and jade, such as: arrowheads; human instruments, gods and animals. Metal work impacted the agricultural activity and environmental exploitation, manufactured utilitarian artifacts as well as ornamental and sumptuary objects.\n\nArchitecture reached its peak when ballgame courts appeared, their construction prompted the organizing of large well designed platforms, patios and squares with pyramids of certain elevations, walkways and paved roads, stairways, worship stone carvings, columns as roof support, roofs, posts, palm and grass, utilization of adobe walls and floors. The burial was common in large pots where skeletons lie in sitting or extended position, accompanied by offerings primarily made of pottery.\n\nThe \" Aztatl\u00e1n Tradition \" flourished in the south of the State with the cultural development of Ixtl\u00e1n de R\u00edo, on a period from around 750 BCE to 1110 CE, recognized as the Mid-Ixtl\u00e1n period. Its early phase corresponds to the period that goes from 300 BCE to 600 CE.\n\nFrom the \"Aztatl\u00e1n Tradition\" the Shaft Tombs are highlighted, and it is noted that the discovery of Smoking pipes vestiges in Amapa imply that tobacco was farmed, there are also samples that demonstrate the use of metals, form manufacturing needles and fish hooks, also bricks for construction evidence was found.\n\nIn more recent times, within the \"Aztatl\u00e1n tradition\", the now called Sentispac town, formerly known as Tzenticpac or Centicpac, was the seat of the lordship of the same name, which extended to Omitl\u00e1n, Itzcuintla, Cillan and Atecomatl\u00e1n and was occupied by Totorames native groups, who dominated and receiving tributes from Coras and Zayahuecos settled in the same coastal region.\n\nToponymy\n\nThe word \"Ixtl\u00e1n\" is of Nahuatl origin, composed by the words \"Itz-ittztell\" that means obsidian, and \"Tl\u00e1n\", that means place with abundance, that is, \"Place where obsidian is abundant\".\n\nAccording to the Mexican Municipalities Encyclopedia, Ixtl\u00e1n, means place dedicated to Eh\u00e9catl, Wind God.\n\nHistory\n\nThis important site was very possibly occupied from 300 BCE through 600 CE. During the first stage a cultural complex was developed known as the Shaft Tomb tradition in which offerings were placed inside of funeral chambers. Between 500 and 600 CE the Shaft Tomb tradition is abandoned and its development is registered within an ample cultural region known as Aztatl\u00e1n, with an apogee towards 750 and 1,100 CE.\n\nWith the \"Tradici\u00f3n Aztatl\u00e1n\" develops a new way of life and it begins towards 750 \u2013 900 CE. This cultural development is identified as mid-Ixtl\u00e1n period (750 - 1110) that represents the apogee of the city, dedicated to Eh\u00e9catl (Wind God); and late Ixtl\u00e1n (1110\u20131525CE) identified by red smooth ceramic for domestic use as well as cajetes and tripod molcajetes decorated with white designs over red.\n\nThe city was founded in the 12th century, by Nahuatlaca tribes en route towards the Valley of Mexico, forming the Ahuacatl\u00e1n Lordship, known by its building construction and trading of obsidian goods.\n\nIt is then that the urban settlement grows considerable with the construction of large terraces, palaces, temples and altars, acquiring a certain regional importance as manufacturing and commercial trade center. Although more than 85 mounds and structures have been located in the site, that remain still unexplored, at the moment it is only possible to visit fifteen structures, among them the building called Quetzalcoatl Temple that displays a circular shape with a parapet surrounding it and with peculiar perforations in cross shape.\n\nThe temple has two altars on top of the Mexico Central Plateau style. Other important buildings are structures called \"Reliefs Palace\", \"Columns Palace\", the \"Four Column Palace\" complex and the \"Square Palace\".\n\nIxtl\u00e1n is the most studied archaeological zone in Nayarit. Its influence zone extended to the present day municipalities of Ixtl\u00e1n del Rio, Ahuacatl\u00e1n, Jala and Santa Maria del Oro. Their main towns were Cacalut\u00e1n, Tepuzhuac\u00e1n, Mexpan, Zoatl\u00e1n, Xala, Jomulco, Tequepexpan, Camotl\u00e1n, Tetitl\u00e1n, Acuitapilco and Zapot\u00e1n.\n\nPetroglyphs\n\nIn Santiago Ixcuintla, INAH has registered the existence of petroglyphs from the \"Los Concheros\" epoch, in the Las Parejas, Em\u00e9rita, Yago, El Caballo and Acat\u00e1n de las Pi\u00f1as sites, with a total of 13 engravings, including the \"Piedra Galana\".\n\nThe presence of prehispanic vestiges in the",

  "John Davis Long\n\nJohn Davis Long (October 27, 1838 \u2013 August 28, 1915) was an American lawyer, politician, and writer from Massachusetts. He was the 32nd Governor of Massachusetts, serving from 1880 to 1883. He later served as the Secretary of the Navy from 1897 to 1902, a period that included the primarily naval Spanish\u2013American War.\n\nBorn in Buckfield, Maine, Long was educated as a lawyer at Harvard University, later settling in Hingham, Massachusetts. He became active in Republican Party politics in the 1870s, winning election for the state legislature in 1874. He rose rapidly in prominence, and was elected lieutenant governor in 1879 and governor in 1880. He advocated modest reforms during his three years as governor, which were relatively uneventful.\n\nAfter returning to private practice he was offered a cabinet post by his friend, President William McKinley, in 1896. He chose to become Secretary of the Navy despite lacking detailed knowledge of naval matters. He clashed with his Under-Secretary, Theodore Roosevelt, over expansion of the Navy when the Spanish\u2013American War broke out in 1898. He resigned the post after Roosevelt became president, and resumed his law practice. He died at his home in 1915; his publications include a lifelong journal, a history of the Spanish\u2013American War, and a verse translation of Virgil's Aeneid.\n\nEarly years\n\nJohn Davis Long was born in Buckfield, Maine on October 27, 1838, to Zadoc Long and Julia Temple (Davis) Long. He was named for Massachusetts Governor John Davis, a cousin of his maternal grandfather. He received his primary education at Hebron Academy until attending Harvard University where he graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1857. At Harvard he was a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity's Alpha chapter. Long wrote both prose and verse for a student magazine, and was chosen to write an ode for his class's graduation. He also began a private journal some time before his arrival at Harvard, which he maintained throughout his life.\n\nAfter two years as headmaster of Westford Academy in Westford, Massachusetts, Long began attending Harvard Law School, becoming a member of the Massachusetts bar in 1861. He practiced law, first without success in Buckfield, and then in Boston, and was active in the state militia during the American Civil War. He moved to Hingham, Massachusetts in 1869, and the following year married Mary Woodford Glover of Hingham. The couple had two daughters (and one stillborn birth) before her death in 1882.\n\nMassachusetts politics\n\nLong began his involvement in politics at the local level in Hingham in 1870. Temperance was a major issue which dominated his political beliefs. His early politics was somewhat independent: he supported the reformist Republican Benjamin Butler for governor in 1871, but received an unsolicited Democratic nomination later that year for a seat in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. He did not campaign, and lost the election. Nominated by both Democrats and reformist Republicans in 1872, he lost again. He thereafter became more of a Republican stalwart, convinced that reform would be best accomplished from within the party organization.\n\nIn 1874 Long chaired the state Republican convention, and finally won election to the state legislature. He formed a close relationship with Speaker John E. Sanford, and in what historian James Hess describes as a probable move of political calculation, supported the successful gubernatorial candidate in 1875, Alexander H. Rice, even though Rice supported liberal legislation on alcohol sales that Long opposed. He was able to parlay this support into his own election to the speakership in 1876. He widened his reform views to the national stage by supporting Benjamin Bristow in his unsuccessful bid for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nLietuentant Governor (1879\u201380)\n\nIn 1877, Long unsuccessfully challenged the incumbent Rice for the gubernatorial nomination. When Rice announced his retirement the following year, Long again sought the nomination. It went to former Lieutenant Governor Thomas Talbot, but Long won the lieutenant governor nomination by acclamation. The Democratic opposition was divided by Benjamin Butler's return to that party, and the Republican ticket won the general election. Long capitalized on Talbot's avoidance of public ceremonies to maintain a high profile despite his post's relative unimportance.\n\nGovernor (1880\u201383)\n\nIn 1879, Long was easily nominated for governor when Talbot announced he would not run for reelection, despite a lack of support from the party leadership. The election was highly divisive, pitting Long against Butler and the divided Democrats. Long was criticized for his lack of Civil War service and attacked for his diversions from the party line, but won a comfortable victory. He was reelected by comfortable margins the two following years.\n\nLong's time as governor was described by historian P.A.M. Tayler as relatively uneventful. He proposed a number of modest reforms, including a measured expansion of women's voting rights (then restricted to voting for school committees), and allowing women to sit on state boards. Most of these reforms were not implemented during his tenure, although some were later enacted into law by his successors. He kept a busy schedule, attending all manner of civic events across the state.\n\nGov. Long re-organized the state government, disputed a statewide law regarding the death penalty, and cut taxes on mortgages in addition to local shipping. Viewing his administration as efficient, Long wrote in his journal that he \"filled [the governorship] well and honestly and not without grace and brilliancy.\"\n\nIn one of his last acts as governor, he appointed Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. The lame duck appointment was occasioned by the sudden resignation of Otis Lord, a Republican who may have resigned in order to deny the appointment opportunity to the incoming Democratic Governor, Benjamin Butler. The appointment was made on December 8, 1882, the last day of Long's term when the Governor's Council (which had to approve the appointment) was scheduled to meet.\n\nStrategist for \"Half-Breed\" Republicans\n\nLong's support for civil service reform aligned him with the congressional \"Half-Breed\" faction. Along with Massachusetts senators Henry L. Dawes and George F. Hoar, he formulated a strategy for the Half-Breeds in the 1880 United States presidential election.\n\nUltimately, the devised strategy was to push for staunch Half-Breed Vermont senator George F. Edmunds at the Republican National Convention to avoid nominating either Ulysses S. Grant, a favorite of the opposing congressional Stalwarts, or Blaine faction leader James G. Blaine, both of whom opposed civil service reform. Two factors contributed to caution surrounding the strategy of the Edmunds supporters, one being an abundance of carefulness not to reveal their plans too soon and the other pertaining to Edmunds' lack of enthusiasm for becoming president.\n\nIn early April 1880, Sen. Hoar instructed political followers of Half-Breeds that the state needed to send men to the party convention with \"no labels about their necks\" while also sending at-large delegates to be labeled conspicuously as supporters of Edmunds. The Massachusetts state convention later that month endorsed Edmunds for president. Edmunds ultimately was unable to garner enough votes to be nominated, though the Half-Breeds managed to block Grant from being selected. A last-minute maneuvering between the Half-Breeds and supporters of Blaine led to the nomination of dark horse candidate James A. Garfield, who went on to win the general election.\n\nU.S. Representative (1883\u201389)\n\nLong was elected to the United States Congress in the 1882 election, and served until 1889, declining to run for reelection in the 1888 election. In 1886, he was encouraged to stand for the Senate by Henry Cabot Lodge, although Lodge's support was apparently part of a ruse to test the strength of the state party leadership. Lodge withdrew his support at the last minute, throwing it instead to the incumbent Henry L. Dawes, and the legislature reelected Dawes to the seat. The incident cooled relations between Lodge and Long. In the wheeling and dealing that preceded the Senate election, Long was offered Democratic support by Butler, but refused, believing that such votes would be seen as tainted by an unsavory political deal.\n\nLong's tenure in Congress was uneventful, since the Congress was under Democratic Party control for the six years he served. In addition to lobbying the administration for patronage appointments, he sat on a joint committee examining interests of shipbuilding and shipowners, as well as on conference committees dealing with pensions and Navy financing. In 1886 Long married again, to Agnes Pierce, a teacher and daughter of a Universalist minister; they had one son, born in 1887.\n\nReturn to private practice\n\nLong decided in 1888 not to run for another term in Congress, and spent the next eight years in private practice. His clients were typically corporate interests, and he appeared on their behalf in court as well as in legislative committee hearings. He was sought after as a public speaker, something he engaged in for many years. He remained somewhat active in Republican Party circles, supporting Roger Wolcott's Young Men's Republican Club, which sought to bring new blood into the party. When offered the opportunity to challenge longtime Republican Senator George Frisbie Hoar, he refused.

  "The Silent Cry\n\nThe Silent Cry (Japanese \u4e07\u5ef6\u5143\u5e74\u306e\u30d5\u30c3\u30c8\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb; Man'nen gan'nen no futtoboru, literally Football in the First Year of Man'en) is a novel by Japanese author Kenzabur\u014d \u014ce, first published in Japanese in 1967 and awarded the Tanizaki Prize that year.\n\nPlot\n\nThe novel tells the story of two brothers in the early 1960s: Mitsusaburo, the narrator, a one-eyed, married English professor in Tokyo; and his younger brother Takashi, who has just returned from the US. Mitsusaburo and his wife Natsumi have been through a series of crises. They left their physically and mentally handicapped baby in an institution, while Mitsusaburo's friend committed suicide (he painted his head crimson, inserted a cucumber in his anus and hanged himself). Natsumi has become an alcoholic. Mitsusaburo leaves his job and they all travel to the brothers' home village, set in a hollow in the forest on Shikoku.\n\nThe brothers' family had been one of the leading families in the village. Takashi is obsessed with the memory of their great-grandfather's younger brother, who led a peasant revolt in 1860. Mitsusaburo remembers the affair differently, believing that the leader of the rebellion betrayed his followers. They similarly disagree over the death of their older brother, S, who was killed in a raid on the Korean settlement near the village. Takashi revels in his warrior's death, while Mitsusaburo recalls him as volunteering to be killed in retaliation for the death of a Korean in an earlier raid. Their sister, also mentally retarded, had committed suicide while living with Takashi.\n\nTakashi has agreed to sell the family's kura-yashiki \u2014 a traditional residence-storehouse \u2014 to 'the Emperor', a Korean originally brought to the village as a slave-worker but who has now gained a position of economic dominance, turning the village's other kura-yashiki into a supermarket which has put the smaller shops out of business. Secretly, he has also agreed to sell the Emperor all the family's land.\n\nTakashi begins to organise the youths of the village into a group, beginning with football training. When Mitsusaburo discovers Takashi's deception, he isolates himself from the others, but his wife sides with Takashi. Mitsusaburo goes to live in the kura-yashiki, while Takashi moves his group into the family's main building.\n\nTakashi uses his group to begin an uprising against the Emperor, looting the supermarket and distributing the goods among the people. Takashi also begins a sexual relationship with Natsumi and sends one of his followers to tell Mitsusaburo. The people eventually become disenchanted, however; eventually a girl is killed. Takashi claims that he tried to rape her and then murdered her. He is abandoned by his group and waits for the villagers to come and lynch or arrest him. Mitsusaburo, however, does not believe his story and says that Takashi is using the girl's accidental death as a way to engineer his own violent death. Takashi admits to Mitsusaburo that their sister killed herself after he ended an incestuous relationship with her. After Mitsusaburo scorns Takashi's belief that he will be killed, Takashi shoots himself, writing as a final statement, 'I told the truth'.\n\nThe Emperor comes and begins demolishing the kura-yashiki. A secret basement is discovered in which the brother of the great-grandfather had spent the rest of his life hiding after the failure of his rebellion. Mitsusaburo and Natsumi decide to try to live together again, along with their handicapped baby and Takashi's unborn child, which Natsumi is carrying. Mitsusaburo decides against a return to his old job, instead taking up an offer to work as a translator with a wildlife expedition to Africa.\n\nLiterary significance & criticism\n\nThe Japanese title connects the date of the rebellion (1860, the first year of the Man'en era, and also the year of Japan's first embassy to the US) with the American influence on Japan represented by the Japan-US Mutual Security Treaty of 1960 and by the (American) football with which Takashi begins his own uprising. \u014ce in a later essay compared the imagination of the writer to a clamp connecting the horizontal narrative with the vertical relationship between the two eras. \u014ce also drew a parallel between the back and forth motion of the football being passed and the reciprocal relationship between the stories of the two eras. Michiko Wilson extends the comparison to the thesis-antithesis relationships between the violent and penitential sides of Takashi's character and between the passive, intellectual Mitsusaburo and the active Takashi who is in touch with nature.\n\nSusan Napier emphasises the mythical aspect of the story in her study of the novel. Like many of his earlier works, The Silent Cry has an unreal Arcadian setting, cut off from the rest of Japan and populated with grotesque characters. She argues that the climax of the book, Takashi's suicide, cannot be explained merely as prompted by his guilt over his relations with his sister. Rather, his death is a sacrifice necessary, in terms of the myth, for the redemption of Mitsusaburo and of the village; his incestuous relationship is merely a pretext for the sacrifice.\n\nThe Silent Cry is widely seen as a key work in \u014ce's oeuvre. It is the only novel (other than The Game of Contemporaneity) to which Wilson devotes a whole chapter in her survey of \u014ce's works, while Napier sees it as a turning point in his output between his smaller-scale early works and the broader canvases of the later novels. As such it is, \"perhaps his most successful effort to encapsulate Japanese history, society, and politics within a single tight narrative\". The novel also marks an end to \u014ce's series of works depicting pairs of brothers in pastoral settings, a hiatus which lasted until 1980's The Trial of 'Nip the Buds, Shoot the Kids'.",

  "Ich hatte viel Bek\u00fcmmernis, BWV 21\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach composed the church cantata Ich hatte viel Bek\u00fcmmernis (I had much grief), BWV21 in Weimar, possibly in 1713, partly even earlier. He used it in 1714 and later for the third Sunday after Trinity of the liturgical year. The work marks a transition between motet style on biblical and hymn text to operatic recitatives and arias on contemporary poetry. Bach catalogued the work as e per ogni tempo (and for all times), indicating that due to its general theme, the cantata is suited for any occasion.\n\nThe text is probably written by the court poet Salomon Franck, who includes four biblical quotations from three psalms and from the Book of Revelation, and juxtaposes in one movement biblical text with two stanzas from Georg Neumark's hymn \"Wer nur den lieben Gott l\u00e4sst walten\". The cantata possibly began as a work of dialogue and four motets on biblical verses. When Bach performed the cantata again in Leipzig in 1723, it was structured in eleven movements, including an opening sinfonia and additional recitatives and arias. It is divided in two parts to be performed before and after the sermon, and scored for three vocal soloists (soprano, tenor, and bass), a four-part choir, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of three trumpets, timpani, oboe, strings and continuo.\n\nBach led a performance in the court chapel of Schloss Weimar on 17 June 1714, known as the Weimar version. He revised the work for performances, possibly in Hamburg and several revivals in Leipzig, adding for the first Leipzig version four trombones playing colla parte.\n\nHistory and words\n\nBach composed the cantata in Weimar, but the composition history is complicated and not at all stages certain. Findings by Martin Petzoldt suggest that the cantata began with the later movements 2\u20136 and 9\u201310, most of them on biblical text, performed at a memorial service of Aemilia Maria Haress, the wife of a former prime-minister of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, at the church St. Peter und Paul in Weimar on 8 October 1713. Bach may then have expanded it and presented it for his application in December 1713 at the Liebfrauenkirche in Halle. The performance material of this event, the only surviving source, shows on the title page the designation e per ogni tempo, indicating that the cantata with its general readings and texts is suitable for any occasion.\n\nBach designated the cantata to the Third Sunday after Trinity of 1714. The prescribed readings for the Sunday were from the First Epistle of Peter, \"Cast thy burden upon the Lord\", and from the Gospel of Luke, the parable of the Lost Sheep and the parable of the Lost Coin. The librettist was probably the court poet Salomon Franck, as in most cantatas of the period, such as Erschallet, ihr Lieder, erklinget, ihr Saiten! BWV 172. The text shows little connection to the prescribed gospel, but is related to the epistle reading. The poet included biblical texts for four movements: for movement 2, for movement 6, translated in the King James Version (KJV) to \"Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted in me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance.\", for movement 9 (KJV: \"Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee.\"),  and for movement 11, \"Worthy is the Lamb\", the text also chosen to conclude Handel's Messiah. Similar to other cantatas of that time, ideas are expressed in dialogue: in movements 7 and 8 the soprano portrays the Seele (Soul), while the part of Jesus is sung by the bass as the vox Christi (voice of Christ). Only movement 9 uses text from a hymn, juxtaposing the biblical text with stanzas 2 and 5 of \"Wer nur den lieben Gott l\u00e4sst walten\" by Georg Neumark, who published it with his own melody in Jena in 1657 in the collection Fortgepflantzter Musikalisch-Poetischer Lustwald. Possibly the first version of the cantata ended with that movement.\n\nBach performed the cantata in the court chapel of Schloss Weimar on 17 June 1714, as his fourth work in a series of monthly cantatas for the Weimar court which came with his promotion to Konzertmeister (concert master) in 1714. The so-called Weimar version, his first composition for an ordinary Sunday in the second half of the liturgical year, marked also a farewell to Duke Johann Ernst who began a journey then. A revision occurred during the K\u00f6then years, specifically in 1720. A performance, documented by original parts, could have been in Hamburg to apply for the position as organist at St. Jacobi in November 1720, this time in nine movements and in D minor instead of C minor. As Thomaskantor in Leipzig, Bach performed the cantata again on his third Sunday in office on 13 June 1723, as the title page shows. For this performance, now of eleven movements beginning again in C minor, he also changed the instrumentation, adding for example four trombones to double the voices in the fifth stanza of the hymn. This version was used in several revivals during Bach's lifetime and is mostly played today.\n\nScoring and structure\n\nBach structured the cantata in eleven movements in two parts, Part I (movements 1\u20136) to be performed before the sermon, Part II (7\u201311) after the sermon. He scored it for three vocal soloists (soprano (S), tenor (T) and bass (B)), a four-part choir SATB, three trumpets (Tr) and timpani only in the final movement, four trombones (Tb) (only in Movement 9 and only in the 5th version to double voices in the fifth stanza of the chorale), oboe (Ob), two violins (Vl), viola (Va), and basso continuo (Bc), with bassoon (Fg) and organ (Org) explicitly indicated. The duration is given as 44 minutes.\n\nIn the following table of the movements, the scoring and keys are given for the version performed in Leipzig in 1723. The keys and time signatures are taken from Alfred D\u00fcrr, using the symbol for common time (4/4). The instruments are shown separately for winds and strings, while the continuo, playing throughout, is not shown.\n\nMovements\n\nThe music for this early cantata uses motet style in the choral movements. Biblical words are used in a prominent way. They are treated in choral movements, different from other cantatas of the Weimar period where they were typically composed as recitatives. John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted all of Bach's church cantatas in 2000 as the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage, termed the cantata \"one of the most extraordinary and inspired of Bach's vocal works\". He notes aspects of the music which are similar to movements in Bach's early cantatas, suggesting that they may have been composed already when Bach moved to Weimar in 1708: the psalm verses resemble movements of cantatas such as Nach dir, Herr, verlanget mich, BWV 150, and Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir, BWV 131, the dialogue of the Soul and Jesus (movement 8) is reminiscent of the Actus tragicus, and the hymn in motet style (movement 9) recalls movements 2 and 5 of the chorale cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4.\n\nPart I\n\nThemes of deep suffering, pain and mourning dominate the music in the first part of the cantata. Gardiner notes that five of the six movements are \"set almost obsessively in C minor\".\n\n1\n\nThe work is opened by a Sinfonia similar to the one of the cantata Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen, BWV 12, possibly the slow movement of a concerto for oboe and violin. A sighing motif, the picture of a storm of tears, and the flood image conjured by the upwelling music characterizes the dark and oppressive feeling.\n\n2\n\nThe first vocal movement is a choral motet on the psalm verse \"Ich hatte viel Bek\u00fcmmernis in meinem Herzen\" (I had much trouble in my heart). The music has two contrasting sections, following the contrast of the psalm verse which continues \"aber deine Tr\u00f6stungen erquicken meine Seele\" (but your consolations revive my soul). The word \"Ich\" (I) is repeated several times, followed by a fugal section. A homophonic setting of aber (but) leads to the second section, in free polyphony, marked Vivace. It broadens to Andante for a solemn conclusion.\n\n3\n\nThe soprano aria \"Seufzer, Tr\u00e4nen, Kummer, Not\" (Sighs, tears, anguish, trouble) is one of the first arias in Italian style in a Bach cantata, accompanied by an obbligato oboe",
  "Keskuskatu\n\nKeskuskatu, literally 'Central Street' (Finland Swedish: Centralgatan), is a two block-long pedestrian street in the centrally-located Kluuvi neighborhood of Helsinki, Finland. Along the street are located (from south to north): the Stockmann department store, the Rautatalo building, Domus Litonii, the World Trade Center and the Citycenter Mall, nicknamed \"Makkaratalo\" (lit.'sausage house'). Keskuskatu begins at Pohjoisesplanadi, across from the Swedish Theatre, and ends when it meets Kaivokatu, across from Helsinki Central Station. It is intersected just south of its midpoint by Aleksanterinkatu.\n\nHistory\n\nOriginally named Hakasalmi Street (Hakasalmenkatu, Finland Swedish: Hagasundsgatan) and was only one block-long, stretching from Aleksanterinkatu to Kaivokatu. The idea to extend the street through a city block to ease traffic congestion between Esplanadi park and the central railway station was first proposed by Helsinki Building Supplies, Ltd. (Helsingin Rakennuskauppa Oy) in 1913. A design contest for the proposed street was announced at the time, but ultimately never conducted due to the outbreak of World War I.\n\nIn 1916, the businessman Allan Hjelt and the architect Eliel Saarinen started warming up the idea about punching the street through a city block. Their company Ab Centralgatan Oy bought Helsingin Rakennuskauppa Oy (named Oy Building at the time) and received ownership of the properties on Aleksanterinkatu 52 and Pohjoinen Esplanadikatu 37-41. Saarinen made plans of the street and its business properties in the same year, originally about one street's width to the side of Hakasalmenkatu. The plan was published at the end of the year and was received by the city council for consideration. The council approved the plan in March 1917, but decided that a straight line with Hakasalmenkatu would be better for traffic.\n\nIn the end of the year 1919 the city and the company Ab Centralgatan Oy started negotiations about moving the street as a direct continuation of Hakasalmenkatu. Soon Ab Stockmann Oy joined the negotiations, and ended up buying the entire company in April 1920. So the street was built as a direct continuation of Hakasalmenkatu all the way up to Pohjoisesplanadi according to the zoning plan approved in 1920, also giving the Stockmann block its current form. Continuing the street also affected the construction plans of the department store, requiring the dismantling of several old buildings such as the old premises of Caf\u00e9 Ekberg. Stockmann also received the right to build storage facilities under the street, which has later allowed building an underground corridor connecting the department store with the Akateeminen Kirjakauppa book store. In 1928 the street received its current name according to a proposal from Stockmann.\n\nKeskuskatu was later changed to a walking street in a renovation completed in summer 2014. As part of the renovation, the street was paved with the non-repeating Penrose tiling.\n\nKeskuskatu is one of the properties in the original Finnish edition of Monopoly.",

  "Intelligence collection management\n\nIntelligence collection management is the process of managing and organizing the collection of intelligence from various sources. The collection department of an intelligence organization may attempt basic validation of what it collects, but is not supposed to analyze its significance. There is debate in U.S. intelligence community on the difference between validation and analysis, where the National Security Agency may (in the opinion of the Central Intelligence Agency or the Defense Intelligence Agency) try to interpret information when such interpretation is the job of another agency.\n\nCollection disciplines\n\nDisciplines which postprocess raw data more than collect it are:\n\nCollection guidance\n\nAt the director level and within the collection organization (depending on the intelligence service), collection guidance assigns collection to one or more source managers who may order reconnaissance missions, budget for agent recruitment, or both.\n\nResearch\n\nThis may be an auction for resources, and there is joint UK-US research on applying more formal methods. One method is \"semantic matchmaking\" based on ontology, originally a field of philosophy but finding applications in intelligent searching. Researchers match missions to the capabilities of available resources, defining ontology as \"a set of logical axioms designed to account for the intended meaning of a vocabulary\". The requester is asked, \"What are the requirements of a mission?\" These include the type of data to be collected (distinct from the collection method), the priority of the request, and the need for secrecy in collection.\n\nCollection system managers are asked to specify the capabilities of their assets. Preece's ontology focuses on ISTAR sensors, but also considers HUMINT, OSINT and possible methodologies. The intelligence model compares \"the specification of a mission against the specification of available assets, to assess the utility or fitness for purpose of available assets; based on these assessments, obtain a set of recommended assets for the mission: either decide whether there is a solution\u2014a single asset or combination of assets\u2014that satisfies the requirements of the mission, or alternatively provide a ranking of solutions according to their relative degree of utility.\"\n\nNATO collection guidance\n\nIn NATO, the questions driving collection management are Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIR). PIRs are a component of Collection Coordination and Intelligence Requirements Management (CCIRM) focused on the collection process, uniting the intelligence effort to maneuver through Decision Points (DPs). These questions, refined into Information Requirements (IRs), enable the Collection Manager (CM) to focus assets on a problem. Without this synchronization, it would be impossible to ensure that the intelligence focus meets the commander's requirements and priorities.\n\nDiscipline selection\n\nWhen a PIR defining the information to be collected exists, discipline specialists and resource schedulers select the appropriate collection system and plan the mission, taking into account the capabilities and limitations of collection platforms. Weather, terrain, technical capabilities and opponents' countermeasures determine the potential for successful collection. Through an understanding of all available platforms (tied to questions related to the PIR) the collection manager synchronizes available assets, theatre and corps collection, national capabilities and coalition resources (such as the Torrejon Space Center) to maximize capabilities.\n\nAlternative disciplines\n\nDespite the desirability of a given method, the information required may not be collectible due to interfering circumstances. The most desirable platform may not be available; weather and enemy air-defense might limit the practicality of UAVs and fixed-wing IMINT platforms. If air defense is the limitation, planners might request support from a national-level IMINT satellite. If a satellite will do the job, the orbits of available satellites may not be suitable for the requirement.\n\nIf weather is the issue, it might be necessary to substitute MASINT sensors which can penetrate the weather and get some of the information. SIGINT might be desired, but terrain masking and technical capabilities of available platforms might require a space-based (or long-range) sensor or exploring whether HUMINT assets might be able to provide information. The collection manager must take these effects into consideration and advise the commander on the situational awareness available for planning and execution.\n\nOther sources may take some time to collect the necessary information. MASINT depends on a library of signatures of normal sensor readings, so deviations stand out. Cryptanalytic COMINT can take considerable time to enter into a cryptosystem, with no guarantee of success.\n\nSupport resource management\n\nAn available, appropriate collection platform does not mean it will be useful if the facilities needed to receive and process the information are unavailable. Two factors affect this process: the physical capabilities of the intelligence systems and the training and capabilities of the intelligence section.\n\nCollection platforms able to collect tens of thousands of pieces of information per hour need receivers which can accept that volume. The collection capability, even with self-generating reports, can quickly overwhelm inexperienced or understaffed analysts. While the CM is primarily concerned with collection, they must also know if analysis for the requested system has the resources to reduce and analyze the sensor data within a useful length of time.\n\nIMINT and SIGINT ground stations may be able to accept sensor data, but the networks and information-processing systems may be inadequate to get data to analysts and commanders; an example is imagery intelligence derived from UAVs and fixed-wing IMINT platforms. Commanders and staff are accustomed to receiving quality imagery products and UAV feeds for planning and execution of their missions. In exercises, this is often done with high-speed fixed networks; in a mobile, fluid battle it would be nearly impossible to develop a network capable of carrying the same amount of information. The CM must decide if an analytic report (rather than the imagery itself) will answer the question; when a hard-copy image or video is required, the CM must inform staff members of the cost to the IT network and HQ bandwidth.\n\nCollection management is the cornerstone on which intelligence support to ARRC operations is built. Since the starting point of the collection process is the commander's PIRs, they are a critical component of the staff planning process and support the commander's decision-making.\n\nCIA collection guidance\n\nIntelligence requirements were introduced after World War II. After an initial phase where field personnel decided priorities, an interim period began in which requirements were considered \"as desirable but were not thought to present any special problem. Perhaps the man in the field did, after all, need some guidance; if so, the expert in Washington had only to jot down a list of questions and all would be well.\"\n\nIn a third phase (by the early 1950s), a consensus was established that a formal requirement structure was needed. When that machinery was set up, specialized methodologies for requirement management needed to be developed. The methodologies first needed were those used against the Sino-Soviet bloc, and radical changes in the threat environment may make some of those methodologies inappropriate.\n\nRequirements may be cast in terms of analysis technique, collection method, subject matter, source type or priority. Heffter's article says that not every problem is a special case, but may be a problem \"central to the very nature of the requirements process. One cannot help feeling that too little of the best thinking of the community has gone into these central problems\u2014into the development, in a word, of an adequate theory of requirements.\" \"But there is often a conspicuous hiatus\" between requirements produced at a managerial level \"and the requirements produced on the working level. Dealing with general matters has itself become a specialty. We lack a vigorous exchange of views between generalists and specialists, requirements officers and administrators, members of all agencies, analysts in all intelligence fields, practitioners of all collection methods, which might lead at least to a clarification of ideas and at best to a solution of some common problems.\"\n\nPriorities\n\nPriority-based needs must be presented, with the best way to meet those needs based on an effective use of the collection means available. Heffter's paper centers on the management of priorities for the use of collection assets; three factors which must be balanced are:\n\n\"... Each of the three kinds answers a deep-felt need, has a life of its own, and plays a role of its own in the total complex of intelligence guidance\". Since Heffter focused on the problem of priorities, he concerned himself chiefly with policy directives, which set overall priorities. Within that policy, \"requests are also very much in the picture since priorities must govern their fulfillment\".\n\nRequirements\n\nA collection requirement is \"a statement of information to be collected\". Several tendencies hinder precision: These differing desires can cause friction or complement one another. The tendencies can complement each other if brought into balance, but their coexistence has often been marked with friction. The characteristics of a requirement are:\n\nIn intelligence, the meaning of \"require\" has been redefined. Under this interpretation, one person (the \"customer\") makes a request (or puts a question) to another of equal status (the collector) who fulfills (or answers) it as best they can.\n\nThere is an honor system on both sides:\n\nThe relationship is free from compulsion. The use of direct requests appeals to collectors, who find that it provides them with more viable, collectible requirements than any other method. It sometimes appeals to requester-analysts, who (if they find a receptive collector) can get more requirements accepted than would be possible otherwise. The elements of need, compulsion and request are embodied in three types of collection requirements: the inventory of needs, addressed to the community at large and to nobody in particular; the directive, addressed by a higher to a lower echelon; and the request, addressed by a customer to a collector.\n\nInventory of needs\n\nIntelligence watch centers and interdisciplinary groups, such as the Counterterrorism Center, can create and update requirements lists.

Nearby notable buildings include the Royal Court Theatre, the department store Peter Jones and the Sloane Square Underground station.\n\nHistory\n\nThe building has been a hotel for over a century, ever since the rebuilding of the northern side of Sloane Square during the 1890s. In 1900 the lease for the site was taken by George Bernard and Amos Ballard, who completed the building and opened it as the Royal Court Hotel. By 1919, the running of the hotel had been taken over by the hotelier Auguste Wild. In 2005 the hotel was bought by the hotelier John Tham, former managing director of the Cliveden hotel, and renamed the Sloane Square hotel. It was completely renovated in 2006.\n\nFollowing the bombing of Sloane Square Underground station in 1940, the hotel was used as staging post for treating casualties.\n\nIn early 1960, the hotel was temporary home to Peter Llewelyn Davies, a leading figure in London's publishing industry and the inspiration for J.

In February 1939, Schultheis joined The Walt Disney Company in the Special Effects department, at the old Hyperion Avenue Studios in Silver Lake, where he worked on a number of films, most notably on the animated features Fantasia and Pinocchio. He left Walt Disney in June 1940. In 1949, he started employment with Librascope as a patent engineer.\n\nDisappearance and recovery of remains\n\nSchultheis was a dedicated amateur photographer and archeologist who traveled regularly to pursue his hobbies. In 1955 he traveled to Guatemala, where he was last seen on May 20. On that day he hired an airplane to fly him from Flores to a landing area in the vicinity of Tikal, where he intended to take photographs of the nearby ruins. Upon arriving at his destination, he arranged to be picked up three hours later for the return flight. Schultheis was last seen headed into a jungle area that was in the direction of the ruins. With no sign of him at the agreed upon departure time, the plane and crew left. They returned the next day, then the day after that, but still did not find him. Efforts by search parties on the ground and in the air failed to find him. Officials with the American Embassy in Guatemala reported in June 1955 that chances of finding Schultheis by that point, whether alive or dead, were \"problematical.\" His remains were discovered on November 23, 1956, by a local chicle worker. Two cameras, a pair of rubber-soled shoes, and a bag with personal items were also recovered.\n\nSchultheis notebook\n\nSchultheis documented advanced special effect techniques used in Disney films in a notebook titled Special Effects. It is on display at The Walt Disney Family Museum in San Francisco, California. His detailed notebook, documenting the special effects for Fantasia, is the subject of a 14-minute short-subject included on the film's DVD. The notebook, once offered to Disney for the sum of $400 in 1939, was discovered by Disney historian Howard Lowery hidden away in a Murphy bed in his Los Angeles residence upon his widow's death in the early 1990s.\n\nJohn Canemaker's book, The Lost Notebook: Herman Schultheis and the Secrets of Walt Disney\u2019s Movie Magic is a partial reproduction of the notebook. Canemaker called Schultheis' book \"the Rosetta Stone of Disney animation.\"\n\nThe Herman J. Schultheis Collection of International Photographs, 1927\u20131950\n\nThe Schultheis Collection is composed of original photographic prints documenting Schultheis' various travels to the Mediterranean region, South America, the Caribbean, Mexico, and the eastern half of the United States, as well as many photos that document a wide swath of life in Southern California. Following the death of Ethel in 1990, conservators found a trove of thousands of photographs in the Schultheis home in Los Feliz, Los Angeles. The collection was deeded to the Los Angeles Public Library, and nearly 6,000 are available in their Digital Collections.",

  "Fernand Sabatt\u00e9\n\nFernand Sabatt\u00e9 was a French painter and sculptor who is best known for his architectural painting and portrait work, as well as salvaging church monuments and bombed out churches in the zone rouge during World War One.\n\nEarly life\n\nHe was born in Aiguillon, Lot-et-Garonne 14 May 1874. Sabatt\u00e9's parents separated in 1880 and he moved with his mother to Bordeaux. Having studied at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, in 1893 he began working there in the studio of Gustave Moreau. At his first exhibition at the Paris Salon, a portrait of his grandmother was purchased by the state.\n\nArtistic career and recognition\n\nIn 1900 he won the Grand Prix de Rome for his painting Un Spartiate et l'Ilote. From 1926 he taught painting, first at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Lille until 1929, then at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. His student Louise Cottin won a second prize of Rome in 1934. Also in 1929, he founded the bimonthly magazine Art. He entered the Academy of Fine Arts of the Institute of France in 1935 (painting section, chair 5). Viewed as an academic painter, who was heavily influenced by his religion, which has been described as bordering on mystical. He remained heavily influenced by his tutor Moreau, retaining a very realistic style of painting, only briefly experimenting with Impressionism. He is credited, amongst other Paris artists, as fostering a new generation of modern women artists. There is a street in his native Aiguillon named in his honour.\n\nMilitary career\n\nDuring World War 1 Fernand Sabatt\u00e9 received the Croix de guerre and became a Chevalier (Knight) in the Legion of Honour. He was decorated for his services, while serving as an army officer, responsible for salvaging art works and sculptures from bombed-out towns in Northern France from 1916-1918, while simultaneously painting scenes of ruined churches and civic buildings, and can therefore be classed as a war artist. He held the rank and title of \u2018Chef de la section du front du Nord du service de protection et d\u2019\u00e9vacuation des monuments et oeuvres d\u2019art\u2019. Today an extensive series of photographs featuring Sabatt\u00e9 shows the damaged buildings which his unit surveyed, today held at the M\u00e9diath\u00e8que de l\u2019Architecture et du Patrimoine, Paris.\n\nIt is not known exactly when Sabatt\u00e9 enlisted with the French army, although a patriotic postcard sent to fellow ex alumni of the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, now serving in the French army, is dated 1915. We know that he was appointed head of his unit, the Protection et d\u2019\u00e9vacuation des monuments et oeuvres d\u2019art in October 1916.\n\nSalvaging damaged church artefacts in the Zone Rouge\n\nThe journal Le Bulletin de la vie artistique\u00a0published in 1920, provides a concise history of his unit. It states that after the cataclysmic Battle of Verdun in 1916, the French government took proactive steps to evacuate art from the zone rouge, as well as salvage wrecked buildings, particularly churches, destroyed by artillery under the authorisation of L\u2019administration des Beaux Arts. In October 1916 this unit was officially instituted with its orders to salvage artefacts and bring them to rear area depots, where rudimentary conservation work could be carried out. Divided into three sectors \u2013 Central (Argonne and Somme), East (Argonne and Swiss), and North (Somme and Belgium) \u2013 this third section was headed-up by Fernand Sabatt\u00e9. Four depots were set up under his command; Chateau Martainville (Rouen), Chateau d\u2019Eu (Dieppe), Abbeville \u00a0and Arras. The following description of his salvaging work is extracted from the Bulletin de la Commission d\u00e9partementale des monuments historiques du Pas-de-Calais, 1920 and provides this connection. \"Il convient surtout de nommer le lieutenant du g\u00e9nie Sabatt\u00e9, chef du service des monuments et objets d'art de la zone des arm\u00e9es. Pendant la guerre, ce brave officier fit preuve d'un z\u00e8le et d'un courage au-dessus de tout \u00e9loge. Admirablement second\u00e9 par une \u00e9quipe de soldats, sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s dans ce service, il proc\u00e9da au sauvetage de nos oeuvres d'art jusque sous le feu de l'ennemi, au milieu des obus et des incendies. Et le Mus\u00e9e vraiment remarquable, install\u00e9 par lui \u00e0 Arras, dans un vaste hangar, autrefois salle de gymnastique, t\u00e9moigne du succ\u00e8s de son intervention. En 1919, il n'a cess\u00e9 de parcourir les villages d\u00e9vast\u00e9s, fouillant les d\u00e9combres des \u00e9glises; chaque jour son mus\u00e9e s'enrichissait de quelque statue, pierre tombale, cloche ou b\u00e9nitier, rescap\u00e9 au milieu des ruines.\"\"It is worth mentioning Lieutenant of (Administrative) Engineering, Sabatt\u00e9, Chief of the Monuments and Arts Service in the war zone. During the war this brave officer proved his zeal, courage and above all (deserves our) praise. Admirably assisted by a team of soldiers who specialised in this service, he proceeded to rescue our artworks even under enemy attack, (even) in the midst of shells and fires. And the truly remarkable Museum, established by him in Arras, in a large store, formerly a gymnasium, demonstrates the success of his intervention. In 1919, he continued to visit the devastated towns, searching the rubble of churches; and so every day the museum was enriched by some statue, stone tombstone, bell or font, survivors from the ruins.\"\n\nGerman frightfulness and apportioning war guilt\n\nThe bombardment of Arras, and the destruction of its medieval belfry, caused consternation in France and was utilised for propaganda purposes as an example of German Frightfulness or Schrecklichkeit. Approximately a dozen French and Belgian towns received bombardment by German artillery during World War One, including the Cathedral of Rheims, Library of Leuven, Soissons, Ypres, Mauberge and Arras, and these towns were referred to in contemporary press reports as the martyred towns (or Les villages d\u00e9truits). The identity of Sabatt\u00e9 in this unit is established in a photograph listing his name during a ministerial visit to the depot at Abbeville on 26 July 1918. Sabatt\u00e9's work continued into 1919. From photographs held at the M\u00e9diath\u00e8que de l\u2019Architecture et du Patrimoine, it can be seen that his unit in Arras utilised German Prisoners of War, and this project is an outcome of the French government's determination to publicise German war guilt and to give evidence to its reparation payments.\n\nPainting war ruins\n\nIn 1916 he painted Int\u00e9rieur de la cath\u00e9drale d\u2019Arras en ruines, en 1916 (Collection Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Paris). In this painting he wrote an inscription at the lower right hand corner of the canvas, that his painting session was \"interrupted by the explosion of an artillery shell of huge calibre, 20th May 1916\". In the archive collection of the Monuments Historiques, the database lists 23 photographs taken by Sabatt\u00e9 of Arras, showing war damaged buildings, so it is highly likely that he worked from photographs in order to produce the painting, the Arras Belfry (Belfroi) held in the National Gallery of Ireland, from his salvage warehouse in the town.\n\nSabatt\u00e9 died after being struck by a German truck in Chamigny 22 October 1940.",

  "Way\u00e9tu Moore\n\nWay\u00e9tu Moore (born 1985) is a Liberian-American author and social entrepreneur. Her debut novel, She Would Be King, was published by Graywolf Press in September 2018, and was named a best book of 2018 by Publishers Weekly, Booklist, Entertainment Weekly & BuzzFeed. The novel was positively reviewed by Time Magazine, The New York Times, and The New Yorker. Moore has published work in The New York Times, The Paris Review, Guernica Magazine, The Atlantic, and other journals. She was awarded a Lannan Literary Fellowship for fiction in 2019. Moore's memoir, The Dragons, The Giant, The Women, was named a 2020 New York Times Notable Book, a Time Magazine 10 Best Nonfiction Books of 2020, and a Publishers Weekly Top 5 Nonfiction Books of 2020. In 2011, Moore founded a publishing house and nonprofit organization, One Moore Book, which publishes and distributes books intended for children in countries underrepresented in literature.\n\nLife\n\nMoore was born in 1985 in Liberia. She is one of five siblings. She is of mixed Vai, Gola and Americo-Liberian ancestry. Her mother is a professor of English, and the founding Dean of Liberia Honors College at the University of Liberia. Her father is a professor of engineering and Dean of The College of Engineering at the University of Liberia.\n\nWhen she was five years old, Moore's family fled their home in Monrovia to escape the First Liberian Civil War. To protect the children from the horrors of the war, Moore's father and grandmother created a magical narrative for them in which gunshots were \"dragons fighting\" and dead bodies were \"people sleeping on the road\". At the time, Moore's mother was studying at Columbia University on a Fulbright scholarship, and had no news of her family's fate. She flew to Sierra Leone, where she eventually found a female fighter who was able to locate the rest of the family and bring them across the border. Subsequently, the Moore family moved to Houston, Texas. There, Moore read and wrote prolifically, which she credits with helping her overcome the trauma she experienced during the war.\n\nMoore attended New York University's Tisch School of the Arts for theater, before transferring and obtaining her bachelor's degree in journalism from Howard University. She also holds an MFA in creative writing from the University of Southern California and an MA in anthropology and education from Columbia University. She currently lives in New York, New York.\n\nMoore cited Octavia Butler, Toni Morrison, Isabelle Allende, Ben Okri and Salman Rushdie as inspirations. She has also credited Liberian poet Patricia Jabbeh Wesley as a literary inspiration.\n\nOne Moore Book\n\nOne Moore Book, launched in 2011, is a publishing company and nonprofit founded by Moore and her siblings to provide culturally relevant books to children who are underrepresented in literature and live in countries with low literacy rates. \"The goal of the company is to provide books to children who rarely see themselves in books. Our books also serve the dual purpose of giving children here a glimpse of countries they may never have an opportunity to visit,\" Moore said in an interview. The initial books were written by Way\u00e9tu and her sister Wiande, and illustrated by her sister Kula and brother Augustus. These books served as a pilot series for the organization's model. One Moore Book later collaborated on a series of books with Haitian-American author Edwidge Danticat. They currently publish 23 titles, including books set in Liberia, Haiti, Brazil, and Guinea. One Moore Book sells books as well as distributing thousands of free books to children in target countries. Some of their titles are distributed through Scholastic Book Clubs.\n\nOne Moore Book opened a bookstore called One Moore Bookstore in Monrovia in May 2015. It is the first bookstore in Liberia dedicated to selling recreational literature, and also allows visitors to read in the store.\n\nShe Would Be King\n\nMoore's 2018 debut novel, She Would Be King, is set early in Liberia's history and is an example of magical realism, featuring protagonists with superhuman abilities. The novel received largely positive reviews. \"Reading Way\u00e9tu Moore's debut novel, She Would Be King (Graywolf Press), feels a lot like watching a superb athlete's performance,\" Bethanne Patrick wrote in Time Magazine. Lovia Gyarkye wrote in The New York Times: \"She Would Be King is an ambitious and expansive novel that explores the nuances of Liberian history...Ms. Moore skillfully reconsiders the idealism of the early African-American settlers through their interactions with the indigenous peoples and braids together intimate story lines centered around universal themes: falling in love, defying familial expectations and the difficulties of doing the right thing.\" A brief review in The New Yorker stated: \"The force and the symbolism of myth pervade Moore's engrossing tale.\"\n\nThe novel was chosen by Sarah Jessica Parker as the fifth American Library Association Book Club Central pick in 2018.\n\nThe Dragons, The Giant, The Women\n\nThe Dragons, The Giant, The Women, a memoir, was published by Graywolf Press in June 2020. The book describes Moore's childhood experiences during the Liberian Civil War.\n\nIn an interview prior to its publication, Moore said of the book: \"maybe [it will] give a new perspective to the African war story that isn't about some aid worker who came in and saved us, and we weren't in a refugee camp. This was my dad doing what he could to make sure we were safe, my mom risking everything to go back, and this network of women soldiers that created a business trafficking people's families out of the country when no one was allowed out of the country at the time.\"\n\nIn a review in The New York Times, Grace Talusan described the book as \"immersive\" and \"exhilarating\", writing: \"This memoir adds an essential voice to the genre of migrant literature, challenging false popular narratives that migration is optional, permanent and always results in a better life...\"",
  "Anti anti-communism\n\nAnti anti-communism is opposition to anti-communism as applied in the Cold War. The term was first coined by Clifford Geertz, an American anthropologist at the Institute for Advanced Study, who defined it as being applied in \"the cold war days\" by \"those who... regarded the [Red] Menace as the primary fact of contemporary political life\" to \"[t]hose of us who strenuously opposed [that] obsession, as we saw it... with the insinuation \u2013 wildly incorrect in the vast majority of cases \u2013 that, by the law of the double negative, we had some secret affection for the Soviet Union.\" Stated more simply by Kristen Ghodsee and Scott Sehon, \"the anthropologist Clifford Geertz wrote that you could be 'anti anti-communism' without being in favour of communism.\"\n\nAnalysis\n\nSome academics and journalists argue that anti-communist narratives have exaggerated the extent of political repression and censorship in states under communist rule or have drawn comparisons with what they see as atrocities that were perpetrated by capitalist countries, particularly during the Cold War. Among them are Mark Aarons, Vincent Bevins, Noam Chomsky, Jodi Dean, Kristen Ghodsee, Seumas Milne, and Michael Parenti. Academic Albert Szymanski drew a comparison between the treatment of anti-communist dissidents in the Soviet Union after Stalin's death and the treatment of dissidents in the United States during the period of McCarthyism, claiming that \"on the whole, it appears that the level of repression in the Soviet Union in the 1955 to 1980 period was at approximately the same level as in the United States during the McCarthy years (1947\u20131956).\"\n\nIn 1964, socialist historian Theodore Draper used the term \"anti-anti-communism\" to refer to Fidel Castro's consolidation of power in 1959, which preceded the Cuban-Soviet economic agreement of 1960.\n\nJohn Earl Haynes, who studied the Venona decryptions extensively, argued that Joseph McCarthy's attempts to \"make anti-communism a partisan weapon\" actually \"threatened [the post-War] anti-Communist consensus\", thereby ultimately harming anti-communist efforts more than helping them. President Harry Truman called Joseph McCarthy \"the greatest asset the Kremlin has.\" Liberal anti-communists like Edward Shils and Daniel Moynihan had a contempt for McCarthyism. Sociologist Edward Shils criticized an excessive policy of secrecy during the Cold War, which was addressed during the 1997 Moynihan Commission, that led to the misdirection of McCarthyism. As Moynihan put it, \"reaction to McCarthy took the form of a modish anti-anti-Communism that considered impolite any discussion of the very real threat Communism posed to Western values and security.\" After revelations of Soviet spy networks from the declassified Venona project, Moynihan wondered: \"Might less secrecy have prevented the liberal overreaction to McCarthyism as well as McCarthyism itself?\" In 1998, Geoffrey Wheatcroft criticised certain aspects of anti-anti-communism. He suggested that \"one mark of the true anti-anti-communist is an evasive use of language\" such as downplaying historical Soviet espionage.\n\nAcademic Noam Chomsky noted double standards in his criticism of The Black Book of Communism. In outlining economist Amartya Sen's research on hunger that while India's democratic institutions prevented famines, its excess of mortality over Communist China, potentially attributable to the latter's more equal distribution of medical and other resources, was nonetheless close to four million per year for non-famine years. Chomsky argued that if the same methodology of The Black Book of Communism was applied to India, then \"the democratic capitalist 'experiment' has caused more deaths than in the entire history of... Communism everywhere since 1917: over 100 million deaths by 1979, and tens of millions more since, in India alone.\" At a April 2017 conference at the University of Bern called \"Anti-communist persecutions in the 20th Century,\" American historian Ronald Grigor Suny suggested that the panel write \"The Black Book of Anti-communism,\" referencing the controversial The Black Book of Communism.\n\nIn her 2012 book The Communist Horizon, political philosopher Jodi Dean argued that there is a double standard among all sides of the political spectrum, including conservatives, liberals, and social democrats, in how communism and capitalism are perceived nearly two decades after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Dean stated that the worst excesses of capitalism are often minimized, while communism is often equated only with the Soviet Union, and experiments in Eastern Europe, Latin America, Africa, and Asia are often ignored, with an emphasis placed on the Stalin era and its violent excesses including gulags, purges, droughts and famines, and almost no consideration for the industrialization and modernization of the Soviet economy, the successes of Soviet science (such as the Soviet space program), or the rise in the standard of living for the once predominantly agrarian society. The dissolution of the Soviet Union is therefore seen as the proof that communism can not work, allowing for all left-wing criticism of the excesses of neoliberalism capitalism to be silenced, for the alternatives would supposedly inevitably result in economic inefficiency and violent authoritarianism.\n\nOther academics and journalists such as Kristen Ghodsee and Seumas Milne asserted that in the post\u2013Cold War era any narratives which include Communist states' achievements are often ignored, while those which focus exclusively on the crimes of Joseph Stalin and other Communist party leaders are amplified. Both allege this is done in part to silence any criticism of global capitalism. Political scientist Michael Parenti holds that Communist regimes, as flawed as they were, nevertheless played a role in \"tempering the worst impulses of Western capitalism and imperialism\", and criticized left-wing anti-communists in particular for failing to understand that in the post\u2013Cold War era Western business interests are \"no longer restrained by a competing system\" and are now \"rolling back the many gains that working people in the West have won over the years.\" Parenti added that \"some of them still don't get it.\" Vincent Bevins argues that anti-communist mass killings backed by the United States during the Cold War have been far more impactful on shaping the contemporary world than communist mass killings have.\n\nIn a critique of Stephen F. Cohen, Jonathan Chait used a fully hyphenated form of the term in 2014, calling Cohen \"an old-school leftist who has carried on the mental habits of decades of anti-anti-communism seamlessly into a new career of anti-anti-Putinism\", referring to the use of whataboutism or what Chait calls \"defense-by-implication\" as a rhetorical strategy by RT commentators.",

  "Ode to Labrador\n\nOde to Labrador is the regional anthem of Labrador, a constituent region of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada.\n\nHistory\n\nWritten by Dr. Harry Paddon in 1927, it is generally sung to the melody of O Tannenbaum, although alternate melodies have been proposed. The Ode constitutes \"the first major, symbolic declaration of Labradorean solidarity\".\n\nSent to Labrador by the London board of health, this song is analyzed as Paddon's declaration of allegiance to his fellow adopted countrymen and women, and sought to aid in their political mobilisation with the Ode. The symbolic significance of the Ode is further bolstered by the fact that Labrador's definitive boundaries were only determined that very same year.\n\nLabrador's motto, munus splendidum mox explebitur, comes from a line in the song (\"their splendid task will soon fulfil').",

  "Baron Bliss\n\nHenry Edward Ernest Victor Bliss, 4th Baron Bliss, commonly known as Baron Bliss (16 February 1869 \u2013 9 March 1926), was a British-born traveller who willed nearly two million Belize dollars to a trust fund for the benefit of the citizens of what was then the colony of British Honduras, now Belize.\n\nBiography\n\nHe was born Henry Edward Ernest Victor de Barreto and lived in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, England, as a youth. His father was Henry Aldridge, who inherited the estate of his uncle Edward Bliss of Brandon, Suffolk, a manufacturer of flintlock mechanisms for guns, and changed his surname to Bliss under the terms of his uncle's will. In 1855, Henry Bliss inherited the estate and title of his cousin the Baron de Alreyo of the Kingdom of Portugal, although he was styled the Baron de Bliss due to the conditions stated in his uncle's will. In June 1869, he was granted another bequest from Colonel Carlo Antonio Barreto of the Kingdom of Spain, with the stipulation that he change his name to Barreto, and he did so in spite of the earlier limitation from his uncle.\n\nHenry Edward Ernest Victor de Barreto was an engineer by trade and on the death of his father in 1890, became the 4th Baron de Barreto. However during the First World War he reverted to his family name of Bliss, and was known afterwards as Baron Bliss. He was apparently successful in his career, but it is not known how he obtained his fortune, whether due to business acumen or inheritance, or a combination thereof.\n\nBliss became paralysed from the waist down in 1911 at the age of 42, likely due to polio, and was confined to a wheelchair. Despite this, he remained active. He was apparently an avid sailor, but had his yacht confiscated for war purposes during the First World War. When the war ended, he was wealthy enough to retire to a lifetime of fishing and leisure, so to that end he ordered a new 120 ft twin screw yacht from the famous Scottish yacht designer Alfred Mylne, which he christened Sea King II. In 1920, he sailed the yacht to the Bahamas, where he stayed for five years. Meanwhile, his wife Baroness Ethel Alice Bliss stayed in England, living off a portion of his fortune. The couple had no children.\n\nAlthough he had some property there, he eventually grew tired of Bahamanian society and decided to move on. Leaving the Bahamas behind, he sailed to Trinidad and was there for a short while when he came down with a serious bout of food poisoning. Deciding to accept a previous invitation from his friend Willoughby Bullock, who was then Attorney General of British Honduras, he sailed westward, stopping briefly in Jamaica likely for medical attention, and arriving in the Belize City harbour on 14 January 1926.\n\nBliss's health appeared to improve over the next few weeks, and he spent much of this time sailing around the area in his launch, exploring the coastline and fishing. However, just days before his 57th birthday, his health took a turn for the worse, and doctors advised him that he was terminally ill. It was at this time that he decided he would leave the bulk of his fortune to the country, and signed a new draft of his will, dated 17 February. Several weeks later, he died on his yacht, never having landed on the Belize mainland. He was buried in the former site of a Spanish fortress which was extremely damaged after the Battle of St. George's Caye in September 1798 in Belize City, what is now known as Bliss Park. This was a temporary arrangement, and he was later interred in a granite tomb near the sea, with a lighthouse nearby, built with funds from his estate. The burial instructions were explicitly stated in the will.\n\nThe Bliss bequest\n\nAt the time of his death, Bliss's fortune was worth nearly \u00a31 million (about BZ$1.8 million). About $480,000 was claimed by the United Kingdom in inheritance taxes. His will gave specific instructions on how the money was to be used to the benefit of the citizens of British Honduras. Aside from small lifetime annuities to his wife and relatives in England and to his personal staff, the remainder of the funds was placed in a trust, executed by the Governor, the Colonial Secretary, and the Attorney General.\n\nThe original money was to be invested in British stocks and securities, and only the interest earned could be spent, and even that could not be spent on churches, dance halls or schools, except agricultural and vocational ones. One-hundred pounds sterling was to be set aside annually for a regatta, which has since been held every year on Baron Bliss Day. A peculiar condition attached to the money was that no American may be a trustee or an employee of a trustee. No explanation was given.\n\nOver the years, the trust has provided more than $2 million to fund projects, including the Bliss Institute, Bliss School of Nursing, and other capital projects across the country., the fund was still worth roughly $1.5 million.\n\nNational Heroes and Benefactors Day\n\nSoon after his death, the government declared 9 March to be Baron Bliss Day, a national public holiday. This was later renamed to National Heroes and Benefactors Day, and is now observed the Monday closest to 9 March, unless it falls on a Saturday or it has been moved by decree. In 2019, it was celebrated on Monday, 11 March.",

  "Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 nationale de musique\n\nThe Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 nationale de musique was an organisation in late 19th and early 20th century Paris, promoting French music and allowing rising composers to present their works in public. It was founded in the aftermath of France's defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870\u201371 on a strong tide of nationalist feeling, and at first excluded all music by non-French composers. In its first 30 years it gave the premieres of works by composers including Saint-Sa\u00ebns, Chabrier, Franck, Faur\u00e9, Dukas and Debussy.\n\nIn the 1880s the original purely French nature of the society was abandoned, and foreign works and composers were accepted. Under the presidency of Vincent d'Indy the society became increasingly conservative, and a rival organisation, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 musicale ind\u00e9pendante, was set up in 1910 by Maurice Ravel and others, briefly overshadowing the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 nationale. The rival closed down in 1935; the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 nationale continued until 1939 when it was wound up.\n\nAmong the works written for or premiered by the society are Chabrier's Pi\u00e8ces pittoresques, Franck's Variations symphoniques, Faur\u00e9's First and Second Piano Quartets and the song-cycle La Bonne chanson, Dukas's L'Apprenti sorcier, and Debussy's String Quartet and Pr\u00e9lude \u00e0 l'apr\u00e8s-midi d'un faune.\n\nFoundation\n\nThe society was founded during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870\u201371. In the brief lull between the ending of the siege of Paris and the rise and fall of the Paris Commune, a group of French musicians met on 25 February 1871 to agree how to promote French music. Before this, French concert halls were dominated by the German symphonic and chamber repertoire; for example, at the popular Pasdeloup concerts between 1861 and 1873, Berlioz and Gounod were programmed 31 times each, and Saint-Sa\u00ebns 12, compared to 43 performances of Wagner's music and 350 of Beethoven's. A wave of anti-German and nationalist sentiments that arose in the wake of the French defeat made the dominance of German music intolerable to many.\n\nThe moving forces behind the new society were Romain Bussine, professor of singing at the Paris Conservatoire and the composer Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns. An executive committee was formed and had its first meeting on 17 March at Bussine's house in the rue Chabanais. Bussine was president, Ernest Reyer vice-president (replaced by Saint-Sa\u00ebns shortly afterwards), Alexis de Castillon secretary and Jules Garcin assistant secretary. Founding members of the society included Th\u00e9odore Dubois, Henri Duparc, Gabriel Faur\u00e9, C\u00e9sar Franck, Ernest Guiraud, Jules Massenet, and Paul Taffanel. Their nationalist principles were explicit in the constitution, drafted by Castillon:\n\nA biographer of Franck has written \"They were determined to unite in their efforts to spread the gospel of French music and to make known the works of living French composers\". Another clause in the constitution laid down, \"No one can be part of the Society as an active member, unless he is French\". The society adopted the Latin motto \"Ars Gallica\" \u2013 French Art.\n\nThe day after the inaugural meeting of the committee of the new society, an insurrection in Paris led to the establishment and subsequent bloody suppression of the Paris Commune, and musical matters were temporarily abandoned. When peace was restored the society staged its first concert. It took place on 17 November 1871 at the Salle Pleyel in the rue de Richelieu, and featured the Trio in B major by Franck, two songs by Dubois, Five Pieces in Ancient Style by Castillon, a reduction of the Violin Concerto by Garcin, an Improvisation for tenor by Massenet, and the Caprice h\u00e9ro\u00efque for two pianos by Saint-Sa\u00ebns, played by the composer and Faur\u00e9.\n\nDevelopment\n\nThe society leaned heavily towards chamber music and away from opera. Faur\u00e9 later recalled:\n\nAlmost from the outset the society attracted about 150 members. Among those who joined after the founding members were Georges Bizet, Louis-Albert Bourgault-Ducoudray, Vincent d'Indy, Edouard Lalo, Charles Lenepveu and Charles-Marie Widor. The organisers would have liked to present their early concerts with an orchestra, but finances did not permit it, and they made do with pianos. In a study of the Parisian musical scene of the time, Elaine Brody writes that composers came to meetings prepared to offer their own compositions or to accompany singers who performed their m\u00e9lodies, and that this set the society's concerts apart from routine concerts. In the early years, concerts were for members only, but in an attempt to increase the society's income and enable it to pay for orchestras, tickets were later made available to the general public.\n\nIn a survey of the society's work, Alain Cochart lists some of the well-known works premiered by or written for it in its first thirty years. Chabrier's Pi\u00e8ces pittoresques (1881) and Bourr\u00e9e fantasque (1893); Franck's Piano Quintet (1880), Pr\u00e9lude, Choral and Fugue (1885), Variations symphoniques (1886) and String Quartet (1890); Faur\u00e9's Violin Sonata No. 1 (1877) and Piano Quartets Nos 1 and 2 (1880 and 1887); Cinq m\u00e9lodies \"de Venise\" (1892) and La Bonne chanson (1895); Chausson's Symphony (1891); Dukas's L'Apprenti sorcier (1897); and Debussy's String Quartet (1893), Pr\u00e9lude \u00e0 l'apr\u00e8s-midi d'un faune (1894) and Pour le piano (1902).\n\nLater years and legacy\n\nIn 1885 d'Indy was appointed joint secretary of the society. His ambition was to open up the society to non-French music and musicians. As a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Franck he worked with his former teacher to establish a faction for change in the society. In 1886 he achieved his aims and Saint-Sa\u00ebns and Bussine resigned. The first foreign composer whose work the society presented was Edvard Grieg. Franck refused the official title of president of the society, but when he died in 1890 d'Indy took the post. Under him, the new generation of French composers found the society increasingly conservative and less helpful to composers who did not follow the dogmatic compositional precepts taught by d'Indy at his music school, the Schola Cantorum de Paris.\n\nIn 1910 a group of young French composers led by Maurice Ravel rebelled, and set up a rival organisation, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 musicale ind\u00e9pendante (SMI). They secured Faur\u00e9 as their president, and for a while outshone the older body, attracting composers including B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k, Manuel de Falla, Arnold Schoenberg, Igor Stravinsky and Anton Webern. During the First World War strong attempts were made to bring the old and new societies together. D'Indy stood down as president of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 nationale to allow his old friend Faur\u00e9 to become president of both organisations in readiness for the merger, but the younger elements of the SMI were not reconciled with the old guard, and the proposal foundered. The two organisations continued to function separately until the SMI was wound up in 1935, after giving 171 concerts in its 25 years of existence. In the inter-war years the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 nationale presented new works by composers including Arthur Honegger, Francis Poulenc, Bohuslav Martin\u016f and less well-known composers including Henri Lutz, Marcel Pollet, Marcel Lubey and D\u00e9odat de S\u00e9verac. The society's existence came to an end in 1939, under its last president, Florent Schmitt.\n\nIn the early 20th century Romain Rolland wrote:",

  "Alexander Denny\n\nAlexander Denny (July 26, 1940 \u2013 2004), otherwise known as Kji-keptin (Grand Captain) Alex Denny of the Mi'kmaq Grand Council, both a founding member and two-term president (1974\u20131976 and 1992\u20131995) of the UNSI (Union of Nova Scotia Indians), was most prominently known for the role he played in the ongoing battle for recognition of Mi'kmaq treaties and Aboriginal rights. Born to the Eskasoni First Nation and raised by two elders in the community, Denny was taught the importance of Mi'kmaq treaties from a young age. His passion for and knowledge of his community ultimately led Denny to be credited with attaining linguistic and political rights for the Mi'kmaq Nation at an international level. Additionally, It was Denny and the UNSI that organized the very first Treaty Day.\n\nEarly life\n\nDenny's early years were spent in the Eskasoni Nation, where he was born. He acquired much of his knowledge about Mi'kmaq treaties and traditions from his father Andrew, an Elder of the community who along with his wife Mary Anne Denny raised Denny.\n\nEducation\n\nDenny attended school in Eskasoni until the age of 14. He was then sent to Chatham, New Brunswick, to attend boarding school until he moved to PEI, where he attended St. Dunstan\u2019s High School. Denny eventually went on to pursue a degree in business.\n\nUnion of Nova Scotia Indians\n\nIn 1969, Denny, alongside Joe B. Marshall, Noel Doucette, Greg Johnson and Stan Johnson, established the UNSI in response to the 1969 White Paper. The goal of the white paper was to establish equality between Indigenous peoples and Canadians by eliminating the legislated difference between the two groups which would include \"abolishing the Indian Act, phasing out the treaties, and transferring the responsibility for Indigenous peoples from the federal government to the provinces\". This proposal stood in stark contrast to the Mi'kmaq's ongoing battle for recognition of their treaties and Aboriginal rights.\n\nMi'kmaq Society v. Canada\n\nDenny initiated the conversation with the Human Rights Committee of the United Nations in 1980 in reference to Canada's continual ignorance of Mi'kmaq treaties and Aboriginal rights. The following is a famous quote from his letter: \"Canada has and continues to deny our right to self-determination; Canada has and continues to involuntarily confiscate our territory despite the terms of our treaties; Canada has and continues to deprive our people of its own means of subsistence\". Unfortunately, due to a technicality, Denny's communication was deemed inadmissible.\n\nTreaty Day\n\nTreaty Day, organized by Denny and other UNSI, first took place October 1st, 1986, was established in response to the Simon v. The Queen (1985) trial, which validated the 1752 Mi'kmaq peace and friendship treaty. Although it was not explicitly Denny who attained linguistic and political rights for the Mi'kmaq Nation, the verdict of this trial validated the decades worth of research that he and the UNSI had done about these topics.",

  "Amano-Iwato\n\nAma-no-Iwato (\u5929\u306e\u5ca9\u6238) is a cave in Japanese mythology. According to the Kojiki (Records of Ancient Matters) and the Nihon Shoki, the bad behavior of Susano'o, the Japanese god of storms, drove his sister Amaterasu into the Ama-no-Iwato cave. The land was thus deprived of light.\n\nIn order to get Amaterasu out of the cave the other gods called Yao-yorozu-no-kami threw a party outside with wisdom of Omoikane. The goddess Ame-no-Uzume-no-Mikoto performed a lewd dance, eliciting laughter. Amaterasu grew curious about the source of amusement and peeked out of the cave entrance. She became fascinated by her own reflection in the Yata no Kagami mirror which the other gods had crafted and hung before the cave for that purpose, and stood transfixed. Ame-no-tajikarao then forced the cave open and the world was bathed in light once again. As Amaterasu stepped out of the cave a holy seal was applied to it so that she could never go back into hiding.\n\nHigashihongu\n\nThe main shrine called Higashihongu and a hall of worship called Nishihongu (west hall) face each other across the Iwato River gorge.

  "Angel Gomes\n\nAdilson Angel Abreu de Almeida Gomes (born 31 August 2000) is an English professional footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder for Ligue 1 club Lille and the England under-21 national team.\n\nHe began his career with Manchester United at the age of five and progressed through the club's academy. When he made his first-team debut in May 2017, he became the youngest player to play for Manchester United since Duncan Edwards in 1953, as well as the first player born in the 2000s to appear in the Premier League. He made 10 appearances for the Manchester United first team in three years and was released at the end of his contract in July 2020. He signed for Lille in August 2020, but was immediately loaned out to Boavista.\n\nHe has captained England at under-16, under-17 and under-18 levels.\n\nEarly years\n\nGomes started training with the Manchester United academy at the age of six. When he was 13, he represented the under-17s at a tournament in Slovakia in October 2013, and during the 2014\u201315 season, aged just 14, he was twice named on the bench for the under-18s before making his debut as a substitute against Middlesbrough in their final league match. In July 2015, Gomes captained the Manchester United under-15s at the Manchester United Premier Cup and was named Most Valuable Player, despite his team finishing in 12th place.\n\nGomes signed as an academy scholar ahead of the 2016\u201317 season, and on 27 August 2016, he became the youngest player to score a hat-trick for Manchester United at academy level since 2001, despite starting the game on the bench. He also became the third youngest player to achieve the feat in the club's history at 16 years. After sustaining an injury in April 2017, Gomes was forced to miss the Dallas Cup. With 12 goals in 19 starts he was the under-18s' top scorer that season, and in May 2017 he was voted as the Jimmy Murphy Player of the Year, the youngest player ever to receive the award. The following day, he trained with the first team ahead of possible inclusion in the squad for the final Premier League game of the season.\n\nFirst-team breakthrough\n\nGomes made his first-team debut on 21 May 2017, replacing Wayne Rooney in the 88th minute of a 2\u20130 home victory over Crystal Palace. At 16 years, 267 days old, he became the youngest player to represent Manchester United since Duncan Edwards in 1953, as well as the first player born in the 2000s to appear in the Premier League.\n\nOn 13 December 2017, Gomes signed his first professional contract with Manchester United, and on 26 January 2018, he made his FA Cup debut, coming on as an 88th-minute substitute for Marcus Rashford in a 4\u20130 victory against Yeovil Town in the Fourth Round.\n\nOn 25 July 2019, Gomes scored his first senior goal in a 2\u20131 pre-season friendly win against Tottenham Hotspur. However, he found first-team opportunities hard to come by during the 2019\u201320 season, playing just six times in all competitions. Despite protracted negotiations, Manchester United were unable to sign Gomes to a contract extension, and he was released on 30 June 2020.\n\n2020\u201321 season: Loan to Boavista\n\nOn 4 August 2020, Gomes signed a five-year contract with French club Lille, and was immediately loaned out to Portuguese club Boavista for the 2020\u201321 campaign. On his league debut for Boavista, Gomes registered a hat-trick of assists and was awarded man of the match in a 3\u20133 draw against C.D. Nacional. In a match against Moreirense on 2 October 2020, Gomes scored his first goal for the club, a wonder strike from the halfway line. On 2 November, Gomes won a penalty and then converted the spot-kick in a 3\u20130 win against Benfica.\n\nInternational career\n\nIn addition to his native England, Gomes is also eligible to represent Angola and Portugal.\n\nGomes began his international career in August 2015, when he made two appearances for England at under-16 level, both against the United States. He captained the under-16s on two occasions while making a further seven appearances.\n\nHe was called up to the under-17s in August 2016, and scored four minutes into his debut while captaining his nation to a 3\u20131 victory over Belgium. Gomes added another two goals and an assist in his second appearance; a 5\u20130 win over Croatia. In October, he scored again in an 8\u20131 win against Germany. Gomes also scored in qualification for the UEFA Under-17 Championship, but missed out on the tournament in May 2017 due to injury. Gomes scored the fourth goal in England's opening game of the 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup, with an 81st-minute free-kick as they beat Chile 4\u20130. He ultimately captained the team to their first U-17 World Cup title.\n\nHe made his debut at under-18 level on 1 September 2017, when he captained England in a 0\u20130 draw with Brazil.\n\nGomes made his England U20 debut during a 0\u20130 draw against the Netherlands on 5 September 2019.\n\nOn 1 October 2021, Gomes received his first call up for the England U21 squad and made his debut as a substitute during a 1-0 2023 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualification win away to Andorra on 11 October 2021.\n\nStyle of play\n\nGomes' preferred position is as an attacking midfielder. His playing style has been compared to that of Ronaldinho due to his creativity, composure and dribbling. In January 2015, Nani described Gomes as Manchester United's next star. Manchester United graduate Danny Webber said: \"Gomes is still very small, but he sees the game seconds before others. Angel is like Paul Scholes; he can dictate a game with his intelligence.\"\n\nPersonal life\n\nGomes is the son of Angolan-born former Portugal under-21 international Gil Gomes, and was born in Edmonton, Greater London during his father's time at Hendon. The family moved to the Manchester area when Gil joined Middlewich Town, and settled in Salford, where Gomes grew up. Former Manchester United winger Nani is Gomes' godfather, and he has said that Nani's influence was \"massive\" as he was somebody he idolised as a youngster.\n\nHonours\n\nLille\n\nEngland U17\n\nIndividual",

While his sister was imprisoned in Bathinda by subedar Malik Altunia (both Altunia and Bahram Shah planned conspiracy against Razia Sultan) he declared himself the king with the support of forty chiefs. Even so, during Muiz ud din Bahram's two years as king, the chiefs that had originally supported him became disordered and constantly bickered among each other. It was during this period of unrest that he was murdered by his own army in 1242 (died 15 May 1242). After his death, he was succeeded by his nephew Ala ud din Masud, a son of his half-brother Rukn ud din Firuz.\n\n\u00d6gedei Khan of the Mongol Empire appointed Dayir commander of Ghazni and Menggetu commander in Kunduz.

  "Iraq Survey Group\n\nThe Iraq Survey Group (ISG) was a fact-finding mission sent by the multinational force in Iraq to find the weapons of mass destruction alleged to be possessed by Iraq that had been the main ostensible reason for the invasion in 2003. Its final report, Comprehensive Report of the Special Advisor to the Director of Central Intelligence on Iraq WMD (commonly referred to as the Duelfer Report, named after the head of the ISG Charles A. Duelfer), was submitted to Congress and the president in 2004. It consisted of a 1,400-member international team organized by the Pentagon and Central Intelligence Agency to hunt for the alleged stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction, including chemical and biological agents, and any supporting research programs and infrastructure that could be used to develop WMD. The report acknowledged that only small stockpiles of chemical WMDs were found, the numbers being inadequate to pose a militarily significant threat.\n\nFormation\n\nThe ISG was made up of more than one thousand American, British and Australian citizens, with the United States providing the bulk of the personnel and resources for the operation. These people included civilian and military intelligence and WMD experts, as well as a large number of people working to provide armed security and support. David Kay, who had been a weapons inspector after the first Gulf War, was chosen to head the group. The agency tasked as the head U.S. government agency of the ISG was a joint venture of the CIA and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), a Department of Defense intelligence agency. Chosen as the senior military officer of the ISG was MG Keith Dayton, who was tasked TDY from his assignment as Deputy Director, Human Intelligence, Defense Intelligence Agency.\n\nThe Iraq Survey Group replaced the United Nations inspections teams (the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC), led by Hans Blix) and from the International Atomic Energy Agency (led by Mohamed ElBaradei), which had been mandated by the UN Security Council to search for illegal weapons before the conflict (See Iraq disarmament crisis). None had been found.\n\nThe ISG was a combined joint/multi-agency intelligence task force operating in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF). It was made up of personnel from all four services, US Government Agencies, the Australian and UK Armed Forces as well as UK and Australian Governmental Agencies. The ISG mission was to organize, direct, and apply intelligence capabilities and expertise to discover, capture, exploit and disseminate information on individuals, documents and other media, materials, facilities, networks, and operations relative to Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD), Terrorism, Former Regime Intelligence, as well as Iraqi or Third-Country Nationals associated with the Former Regime, detained by the Former Regime, or subjects of Indictment for War Crimes or Crimes against Humanity.\n\nThe ISG's mission also included the ongoing investigation into the fate of United States Navy Captain Michael Scott Speicher, who was shot down in 1991 during the Gulf War. Initially presumed dead, he was later declared missing when evidence emerged after the war that he had survived the crash of his aircraft. On August 2, 2009, the Navy reported that Speicher's remains were found in Iraq by United States Marines belonging to MNF-W's Task Force Military Police. His jawbone was used to identify him after study at the Charles C. Carson Center for Mortuary Affairs at Dover Air Force Base. According to local civilians, Speicher was buried by Bedouins after his plane was shot down. The evidence proved that Speicher did not survive the crash. Senator Nelson attributed the delayed finding to the culture of the locality: \"These Bedouins roam around in the desert, they don't stay in one place, and it just took this time to find the specific site.\"\n\nOrganization and operations\n\nTo make the primary mission of WMD search more manageable, ISG was operationally divided up into several sectors each with its own Sector Control Point. The three sectors were North, Baghdad and South, with Sector Control Point-Baghdad (also known as SCP-B or \"skip bee\") being the primary and largest. The bulk of the ISG staff and SCP-B were located on Camp Slayer at the former Al Radwaniyah Presidential Site on Baghdad International Airport in western Baghdad. One of the major supporting elements of the ISG was the Combined Media Processing Center (CMPC). It consisted of four components, CMPC-Main (CMPC-M) at Camp Al Sayliyah, Qatar, CMPC-Baghdad (CMPC-B) located on Camp Slayer, as well as CMPC-North (CMPC-N), and CMPC-South (CMPC-S). The initial nucleus of the CMPC were drawn from DIA document exploitation personnel. By the summer of 2004, the CMPC had grown to over four hundred mostly civilian document and media processors and linguists/translators living and working primarily in CMPC-M at Camp Al Sayliyah, Qatar, and CMPC-B at Camp Slayer in Iraq.\n\nActing as an independent entity outside of the normal chain of command (ISG reported directly to Donald Rumsfeld), it surveyed and exploited hundreds of possible WMD sites across the breadth of Iraq with very few problems. There were two incidents which incurred fatalities. The first incident was a paint factory explosion of April 26, 2004, which killed two soldiers, US Army sergeants Lawrence Roukey, and Sherwood Baker, and injured several more. The mission had been previously abandoned because of security concerns. These were the ISG's first casualties in over a year of operations. The second was a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device (IED) attack against Charles Duelfer's convoy, which claimed the lives of two of Duelfer's Physical Security Detail, SSG Clinton Wisdom and SPC Don Clary, both of the Kansas Army National Guard's B Battery, 2/130th Field Artillery Battalion.\n\nThroughout the life of ISG, there were two occasions where chemical weapons were found. The first was a single sarin mortar shell which had been reworked into a roadside IED by insurgents. The second was a handful of 122-millimeter rocket warheads filled with inert mustard gas that was recovered near Babylon. Both were thought to be remainders from the Iran\u2013Iraq War, when Iraq was in some sense a US ally, and were useless as offensive weapons. They were later destroyed by ISG personnel. In late 2004 the ISG and the MCTs (mobile collection teams) undertook some counterinsurgency operations, although many details remain classified. There were other missions and organizations operating within the ISG which are Top Secret and are unlikely to be declassified anytime soon.\n\nInterim Progress Report\n\nAfter six months searching for WMD, the ISG issued an Interim Progress Report on October 3, 2003. The team said it had found evidence of \"WMD-related program activities\" but no actual chemical, biological or nuclear weapons. In addition to details of dormant WMD programs, the October 2003 report also includes discoveries of non-WMD programs banned by the UN and concealed during the International Atomic Energy Agency and UNMOVIC inspections that began in 2002. Lines of enquiry adopted by the ISG include the examination of sites across Iraq, as well as interviewing scientists, truck drivers and other workers with possible knowledge of WMD.\n\nDavid Kay resigns\n\nOn January 23, 2004, the head of the ISG, David Kay, resigned his position, stating that he believed WMD stockpiles would not be found in Iraq. \"I don't think they existed,\" commented Kay. \"What everyone was talking about is stockpiles produced after the end of the last Gulf War and I don't think there was a large-scale production program in the nineties.\" In a briefing to the Senate Armed Services Committee, Kay criticized the pre-war WMD intelligence and the agencies that produced it, saying \"It turns out that we were all wrong, probably in my judgment, and that is most disturbing.\" Sometime earlier, CIA director George Tenet had asked David Kay to delay his departure: \"If you resign now, it will appear that we don't know what we're doing. That the wheels are coming off.\"\n\nKay told the SASC during his oral report the following, though: \"Based on the intelligence that existed, I think it was reasonable to reach the conclusion that Iraq posed an imminent threat. Now that you know reality on the ground as opposed to what you estimated before, you may reach a different conclusion-\u2014although I must say I actually think what we learned during the inspection made Iraq a more dangerous place, potentially, than, in fact, we thought it was even before the war.\"\n\nKay's team established that the Iraqi regime had the production capacity and know-how to produce chemical and biological weaponry if international economic sanctions were lifted, a policy change which was actively being sought by a number of United Nations member states. Kay also believed some components of the former Iraqi regime's WMD program had been moved to Syria shortly before the 2003 invasion, though the Duelfer Report Addenda (see below) later reported there was no evidence of this.\n\nOn February 6, 2004, George W. Bush convened the Iraq Intelligence Commission, an independent inquiry into the intelligence used to justify the Iraq war and the failure to find WMD. This was shortly followed by the conclusion of a similar inquiry in the United Kingdom, the Butler Review, which was boycotted by the two main opposition parties due to disagreements on its scope and independence.

  "Critias\n\nCritias (, Kritias; c. 460 \u2013 403 BC) was an ancient Athenian political figure and author. Born in Athens, Critias was the son of Callaeschrus and a first cousin of Plato's mother Perictione. He became a leading and violent member of the Thirty Tyrants. He also was an associate of Socrates, a fact that did not endear Socrates to the Athenian public.\n\nCritias was noted in his day for his tragedies, elegies, and prose works. Sextus Empiricus attributed the Sisyphus fragment to Critias; others, however, attribute it to Euripides. His only known play is Peirithous. In addition, eight shorter quotations from unidentified plays have come down to us.\n\nLife\n\nCritias gave an account of his ancestry which was later recorded in Plato's  Timaeus. Critias's great-grandfather, Dropidas, was an intimate friend of Solon. Dropidas's son, also named Critias, was the grandfather and namesake of the author Critias.\n\nCritias was once a student of Socrates. The two had a strained relationship. However, it is said that Critias was the one who saved Socrates from persecution during the terror of the Thirty Tyrants. However, Critias was very greedy, something that Socrates did not approve of.\n\nAfter the fall of Athens to the Spartans, Critias, as one of the Thirty Tyrants, blacklisted many of its citizens. Most of his prisoners were executed and their wealth confiscated.\n\nCritias was killed in a battle near Piraeus, the port of Athens, between a band of pro-democracy Athenian exiles led by Thrasybulus and members and supporters of the Thirty, aided by the Spartan garrison. In the battle, the exiles put the oligarchic forces to flight, ending the rule of the Thirty.\n\nAccording to the Pyrrhonist philosopher, Sextus Empiricus, Critias denied that the gods existed. Critias also asserted that \"a shrewd and clever-minded man invented for mortals a fear of the gods, so that there might be a deterrent for the wicked...\" The text from which this excerpt originates is known both as the \"Critias fragment\" and the \"Sisyphus fragment.\" Its origins are disputed. Most historians attribute the quotation to the character of Sisyphus in a play by Euripides, but Sextus Empiricus attributed it to Critias.\n\nPlato's description\n\nCritias appears as a character in Plato's dialogues Charmides and Protagoras, and, according to Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, was Plato's great-uncle.\n\nIn the Charmides, Plato implies that Critias' philosophy was that temperance was the art of \"doing our own business.\" Socrates spends the rest of the dialogue challenging this definition as vague and meaningless.\n\nThe Critias character in Plato's dialogues Timaeus and Critias is often identified as the son of Callaeschrus \u2013 but not by Plato. Given the old age of the Critias in these two dialogues, he may be the grandfather of the son of Callaeschrus.",

  "Choline acetyltransferase\n\nCholine acetyltransferase (commonly abbreviated as ChAT, but sometimes CAT) is a transferase enzyme responsible for the synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. ChAT catalyzes the transfer of an acetyl group from the coenzyme acetyl-CoA to choline, yielding acetylcholine (ACh). ChAT is found in high concentration in cholinergic neurons, both in the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS). As with most nerve terminal proteins, ChAT is produced in the body of the neuron and is transported to the nerve terminal, where its concentration is highest. Presence of ChAT in a nerve cell classifies this cell as a \"cholinergic\" neuron. In humans, the choline acetyltransferase enzyme is encoded by the CHAT gene.\n\nHistory\n\nCholine acetyltransferase was first described by David Nachmansohn and A. L. Machado in 1943. A German biochemist, Nachmansohn had been studying the process of nerve impulse conduction and utilization of energy-yielding chemical reactions in cells, expanding upon the works of Nobel laureates Otto Warburg and Otto Meyerhof on fermentation, glycolysis, and muscle contraction. Based on prior research showing that \"acetylcholine's actions on structural proteins\" were responsible for nerve impulses, Nachmansohn and Machado investigated the origin of acetylcholine.\n\n\"An enzyme has been extracted from brain and nervous tissue which forms acetylcholine. The formation occurs only in presence of adenosinetriphosphate (ATP). The enzyme is called choline acetylase.\"\n\nThe acetyl transferase mode of action was unknown at the time of this discovery, however Nachmansohn hypothesized the possibility of acetylphosphate or phosphorylcholine exchanging the phosphate (from ATP) for choline or acetate ion. It was not until 1945 that Coenzyme A (CoA) was discovered simultaneously and independently by three laboratories,   Nachmansohn's being one of these. Subsequently, acetyl-CoA, at the time called \u201cactive acetate,\u201d was discovered in 1951. The 3D structure of rat-derived ChAT was not solved until nearly 60 years later, in 2004.\n\nStructure\n\nThe 3D structure of ChAT has been solved by X-ray crystallography. Choline is bound in the active site of ChAT by non-covalent interactions between the positively charged amine of choline and the hydroxyl group of Tyr552, in addition to a hydrogen bond between choline's hydroxyl group and a histidine residue, His324.\n\nThe choline substrate fits into a pocket in the interior of ChAT, while acetyl-CoA fits into a pocket on the surface of the protein. The 3D crystal structure shows the acetyl group of acetyl-CoA abuts the choline binding pocket \u2013 minimizing the distance between acetyl-group donor and receiver.\n\nHomology\n\nChAT is very conserved across the animal genome. Among mammals, in particular, there is very high sequence similarity. Human and cat (Felis catus) ChAT, for example, have 89% sequence identity. Sequence identity with Drosophila is about 30%.\n\nForms of ChAT\n\nThere are two forms of ChAT: Soluble form and membrane-bound form. The soluble form accounts for 80-90% of the total enzyme activity while the membrane-bound form is responsible for the rest of 10-20% activity. However, there has long been a debate on how the latter form of ChAT is bound to the membrane. The membrane-bound form of ChAT is associated with synaptic vesicles.\n\nCommon and peripheral isoforms of ChAT\n\nThere exist two isoforms of ChAT, both encoded by the same sequence. The common type ChAT (cChAT) is present in both the CNS and PNS. Peripheral type ChAT (pChAT) is preferentially expressed in the PNS in humans, and arises from exon skipping (exons 6-9) during post-transcriptional modification. Therefore, the amino acid sequence is very similar, however pChAT is missing parts of the sequence present in cChAT. The pChAT isoform was discovered in 2000 based on observations that brain-derived ChAT antibodies failed to stain peripheral cholinergic neurons as they do for those found in the brain. This gene splicing mechanism which leads to cChAT and pChAT differences has been observed in various species, including both vertebrate mammals and invertebrate mollusks, suggesting this mechanism leads to some yet-unidentified evolutionary advantage.\n\nFunction\n\nCholinergic systems are implicated in numerous neurologic functions. Alteration in some cholinergic neurons may account for the disturbances of Alzheimer disease. The protein encoded by this gene synthesizes the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Acetylcholine acts at two classes of receptors in the central nervous system \u2013 muscarinic and nicotinic \u2013 which are each implicated in different physiological responses. The role of acetylcholine at the nicotinic receptor is still under investigation. It is likely implicated in the reward/reinforcement pathways, as indicated by the addictive nature of nicotine, which also binds to the nicotinic receptor. The muscarinic action of acetylcholine in the CNS is implicated in learning and memory. The loss of cholinergic innervation in the neocortex has been associated with memory loss, as is evidenced in advanced cases of Alzheimer's disease. In the peripheral nervous system, cholinergic neurons are implicated in the control of visceral functions such as, but not limited to, cardiac muscle contraction and gastrointestinal tract function.\n\nIt is often used as an immunohistochemical marker for motor neurons (motoneurons).\n\nMutations\n\nMutants of ChAT have been isolated in several species, including C. elegans, Drosophila, and humans. Most non-lethal mutants that have a non-wild type phenotype exhibit some activity, but significantly less than wild type.\n\nIn C. elegans, several mutations in ChAT have been traced to the cha-1 gene. All mutations result in a significant drop in ChAT activity. Percent activity loss can be greater than 98% in some cases. Phenotypic effects include slowed growth, decreased size, uncoordinated behavior, and lack of sensitivity toward cholinesterase inhibitors. Isolated temperature-sensitive mutants in Drosophila have all been lethal. Prior to death, affected flies show a change in behavior, including uncontrolled movements and a change in electroretinogram activity.\n\nThe human gene responsible for encoding ChAT is CHAT. Mutations in CHAT have been linked to congenital myasthenic syndrome, a disease which leads to general motor function deficiency and weakness. Further symptoms include fatal apnea. Out of ten isolated mutants, 1 has been shown to lack activity completely, 8 have been shown to have significantly decreased activity, and 1 has an unknown function.\n\nAlzheimer's disease\n\nThe Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves difficulty in memory and cognition. The concentrations of acetylcholine and ChAT are remarkably reduced in the cerebral neocortex and hippocampus. Although the cellular loss and dysfunction of the cholinergic neurones is considered a contributor to Alzheimer disease, it is generally not considered as a primary factor in the development of this disease. It is proposed that the aggregation and deposition of the Beta amyloid protein, interferes with the metabolism of neurones and further damages the cholinergic axons in the cortex and cholinergic neurones in the basal forebrain.\n\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis\n\nThe amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is one of the most common motor neuron diseases. A significant loss of ChAT immunoreactivity is found in ALS. It is hypothesized that the cholinergic function is involved in an uncontrolled increase of intracellular calcium concentration whose reason still remains unclear.\n\nDrugs\n\nNeostigmine methylsulfate, an anticholinesterase agent, has been used to target ChAT. In particular, use of neostigmine methylsulfate has been shown to have positive effects against congenital myasthenic syndrome.\n\nExposure to estradiol has been shown to increase ChAT in female rats.",

The species highly resembles other members of the genus Nymphon, and species identification from morphological traits alone is, therefore, a complex task.\n\nAnatomy and general body description\n\nWhen Willian Elford Leach first found the Nymphon gracile, he described it as an organism having a body that consisted of four feet bearing segments with the first segment being head like, with two eyes on each sides, a cylindrical rostrum inserted under the first segment, mandibles longer than the rostrum that is composed of two joints, a six jointed palpi that were inserted under the mandible, and eight feet. He also stated that the egg carrying part of the female is composed of ten joints. In general terms, the body is composed of four segments and has eight legs. Each leg is composed of eight segments (coxa, first trochanter, second trochanter, femur, tibia 1, tibia 2, tarsus, and propodium) and a claw at the end. The first segment of the body has the proboscis, palp, and chelicera coming off of it and the fourth body segment has the anus. There is a general sketch below to give a better idea of what the anatomy of the N. gracile looks like. It has been known to be very difficult to distinguish the different species of sea spiders but the N. gracile does have some characteristics that can help it be recognized a little easier. N. gracile tend to have a rather elongated proboscis and the smooth cylindrical body of the N. gracile can reach a length of about 4mm. There are signs of sexual dimorphism occurring within the species as the males have been known to typically have larger palps and chelifores. Further the proboscis of the juvenile gracile is shorter and broader than that of an adult.\n\nHabitat\n\nThe species inhabits the sublittoral zone and occurs amongst hydroids and sea anemones. Clusters of the species have been observed off of the coasts of France and United Kingdom. It also has been found along the European Atlantic coast from Norway to Morocco\n\nFood Consumption\n\nThe main organ for food uptake in the species is a triradially symmetric proboscis with a terminal mouth that has three movable lips. The species has laterally positioned chelifores, and dorsally positioned palps. Gland openings near the mouth are suspected to secrete saliva. Food is processed and filtered through the midgut. Intracellular digestion occurs by pinocytosis. The species makes use of all appendages while feeding. Species-specific behavior involves the chelae being used to macerate their prey.\n\nDiet\n\nThe species mainly feeds on coelenterates. The larvae are ectoparasites of hydroids. N. gracile have been observed eating gastropod Nucella eggs in the wild. They have also been seen feeding upon the detritus that had accumulated on their bodies, using their ovigera to pick it up and bring it to their mouth. Since this is their diet, their main source of energy is from lipids and carbohydrate sugars.\n\nSwimming\n\nThe organisms swimming patterns are a hybrid of free-floating and periodic-swimming plankton. The organism appears to prefer free-floating as to reserve energy and only utilizes its ability to swim when necessary for survival. When they do swim it is referred to as a leg-beat cycle or a power stroke. A researcher by the name of Elfed Morgan wanted to know more about these two mechanisms, so he did a study where he collected a handful of N. gracile from Mumbles Point on the Gower peninsula and observed their swimming behavior. He found that there are four pairs of locomotor appendages that are symmetrically arranged around the body. During the leg-beat cycle the legs of the N. gracile beat vertically which causes them to swim with their dorsal side foremost. During the power stroke, the joints between the major segments of the leg are extended for most of the stroke, and there is a recovery stroke after. He concluded his finding by stating how each species of the Nymphon has varied swimming abilities due to having varied lengths of the tibial bristles.\n\nMigration\n\nN. gracile migrate away from the shore to the sublittoral zone during the winter and return to the shore during the following spring. They found evidence of this seasonal off-shore migration in Louis Frage article about them that was published in 1932. Not only did people find out that they migrated, but they found evidence that this migration also plays a role in their life cycle. Before the migration, they are about the age of a young adult, and when they leave for the sublittoral zone, their fertilization occurs. They then return in the following spring when they are sexually mature or ovigerous. These findings were founded by King and Jarvis in 1970. The only issue is that migration takes a lot of energy. Since N. gracile are weak swimmers and have to move large distances, they depend on tidal or off-shore currents for their transportation up and down the shore. A study done by Elfed Morgan on the cost of migration found that their fuels reserves are just enough for them to successfully take advantage of the better tides because swimming off shore is very energetically expensive for the species. They do not swim for long periods of time. On average, they only spend about 30% of their time swimming normally. So if they had to swim off shore themselves, then they would only last for 15 days before they start resorting to tissue metabolism. This is not including the extra energy expenditure for other factors.\n\nReproduction\n\nEggs develop from August to February and are carried on the ovigerous legs of the male Nymphon gracile. The Vitellogenesis process of the eggs has the yolk synthesized intra-o\u00f6cytecally with a small o\u00f6cytic contribution. This process is similar to that seen in annelids and Limulus polyphemus. Males become covered in algae or other biota while carrying eggs.\n\nGenome\n\nNymphon gracile has a circular DNA mitochondrial genome 14,681 bp in length. Compared to other Arthropoda, Nymphon gracile differ in about 10 translocated tRNA genes, 5 tRNA genes, and an inversion of a segment covering 3 coding proteins of the mitochondrial genome sequence. This differentiation between these organisms and these gene rearrangements are happening after the subtaxa of Pycnogonida. Genome sequencing is being used as a phylogenetic marker to see where organisms share evolutionary relationships.",
  "Queers in Love at the End of the World\n\nQueers in love at the End of the World, also stylized as queers in love at the end of the world, is a hypertext game created with Twine.

  "Walsh-McLean House\n\nWalsh-McLean House is a Gilded Age mansion in the Dupont Circle neighborhood of Washington, D.C., located at 2020 Massachusetts Avenue NW. Built in 1901, it is now the Embassy of Indonesia.\n\nHistory\n\nThomas F. Walsh had emigrated penniless from Ireland to the United States in 1869, then over the next quarter century built up a small fortune as a carpenter, miner, and hotel manager. His first daughter (born in 1880) died in infancy, but his daughter, Evalyn (born in 1886), and son, Vinson (born in 1888), both survived. He lost nearly all his life's savings in the Panic of 1893. The family moved to Ouray, Colorado, in 1896, where Walsh bought the Camp Bird Mine (which was thought to have been worked out) and struck a massive vein of gold and silver. Now a multi-millionaire, Thomas Walsh moved his family to Washington, D.C., in 1898. After spending 1899\u20131900 in Paris, France, the Walshes returned to Washington where Thomas Walsh commenced the construction of a mansion on Massachusetts Avenue NW.\n\nThe Walsh-McLean House, completed in 1903, cost $835,000 (the most expensive residence in the city at the time) and had 60 rooms, a theater, a ballroom, a French salon, a grand staircase, and $2 million in furnishings which took several years to purchase and install. Walsh's daughter Evalyn Walsh married Edward Beale \"Ned\" McLean (the publishing heir whose family owned The Washington Post) in 1908, and after her father's death in April 1910 lived in the Walsh Mansion. In 1910, Ned McLean bought the allegedly cursed Hope Diamond for his wife for $180,000 (although the purchase was not formalized until February 1911, and not completed until after a lawsuit settled out of court in 1912). Evalyn Walsh died on April 26, 1947. To cover Evalyn's significant debts, the Walsh Mansion was sold in 1952 to the Government of Indonesia for use as an embassy.",

  "Gypsy Restaurant and Velvet Lounge\n\nThe Gypsy Restaurant and Velvet Lounge was a restaurant and nightclub established in 1947 and located along Northwest 21st Avenue in the Northwest District neighborhood of Portland, Oregon, in the United States. Popular with young adults, the restaurant was known for serving fishbowl alcoholic beverages, for its 1950s furnishings, and for hosting karaoke, trivia competitions and goldfish racing tournaments. The restaurant is said to have influenced local alcohol policies; noise complaints and signs of drunken behavior by patrons made the business a target for curfews and closure. Concept Entertainment owned the restaurant from 1992 until 2014, when it was closed unexpectedly.\n\nDescription\n\nLocated at 625 Northwest 21st Avenue in the Nob Hill area of Portland's Northwest District neighborhood, Gypsy was a \"boisterous\", \"disco-balled\" dive bar, recognizable by its bouncers, karaoke, and \"wobbling smokers\". The Portland Mercury said the restaurant was a \"kinda retro-y bar... popular with a young college-y, drinkin', party crowd\". One Portland resident described the club as \"the kind of place where you can go with your sophisticated friends and look at the Daddy-O decor. Or you can go on a date and snuggle in a corner where the lighting is low. And if you want to meet new people you can stroll through there and see people whose faces you've never seen before, which is a rare thing in Portland.\"\n\nThe interior featured 1950s furnishings and \"pinball-panel\" wall decorations. In 1963, The Oregonian described the artwork on the interior walls, which included a large and colorful painting depicting a gypsy camp, and an \"attractive\" nude called Dian by Grace Harlow, a painter and former student of Louis Bunce. The venue also featured \"mottled\" iridescent red windows that were translucent, could seat 150 guests, and included a banquet area.\n\nGypsy was also known for serving fishbowl alcoholic beverages, and in its final years, for hosting goldfish racing tournaments. The restaurant served soup, sandwiches, and full entrees. Karaoke was available beginning at 9 pm on Tuesday through Saturday evenings.\n\nHistory\n\nGypsy Restaurant and Lounge was established in 1947 and was originally located at 612 Northwest 21st Avenue. In 1948, The Oregonian published an advertisement for business, promoting an eight-course dinner for $1.25, between the hours of 4 pm and 3 am. The restaurant's location was described as \"next to 21st Avenue Theater\", between Northwest Hoyt and Irving Streets. In 1955, the paper reported that $1,000 was stolen from an unlocked safe stored at the Gypsy Restaurant. In 1963, the restaurant and lounge moved to its final location, at the intersection of Northwest 21st Avenue and Hoyt Street, across from Cinema 21. On opening night, the \"New Gypsy\" restaurant reportedly played songs by Frank Fontaine.\n\nAccording to a 1973 Oregonian obituary, Gypsy Restaurant was then owned and operated by Stacy Gurganus. An obituary published by The Oregonian in 1987 said that Gertrude \"Tiny\" Hursick of Lake Oswego co-owned Gypsy and Gordon's 7-Up Bar, also located in Northwest Portland. John Hursick continued to own and operate the restaurant until the early 1990s; he died in 1999.\n\nOwnership of Gypsy transferred to Concept Entertainment in 1992. The company has owned other Portland establishments such as Bar 71, Barracuda Nightclub, Dixie Tavern, Grand Central Bowl, the Lotus Cardroom and Cafe, Quest, and the Thirsty Lion. According to Willamette Week, the restaurant had an \"odd\" influence on local alcohol policies. In 1994, city commissioner Charlie Hales and mayor Vera Katz sought to close the Gypsy due to repeated reports of assaults, public intoxication, and noise complaints. However, the Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC) refused. In 2013, when Hales was the mayor of Portland, he unsuccessfully requested that the OLCC enforce a 10 pm curfew for bar patios within the Portland city limits.\n\nIn 2007, Gypsy was one of several Portland sites depicted in \"Virtual Portland\", a three-dimensional computer-generated simulation of the city, designed for Second Life. In May 2013, a tree limb fell and damaged the restaurant.\n\nAfter operating for more than twenty years, and despite having advertised future events at the club, the business closed abruptly on February 20, 2014. Its website and social media pages were shut down immediately, and a sign was posted at the club noting that Concept Entertainment had decided to sell. The space that Gypsy had occupied was immediately available for long-term lease, with furniture included.\n\nEvents\n\nGypsy hosted a variety of musical acts and events throughout its history, including trivia competitions and rock band karaoke, featuring a live backing band. In 1985, the Chris Conrad Quartet performed in the \"Rhythm Room\". In 2000, Gypsy hosted opening and closing night parties for Sensory Perceptions' annual film festival, which spanned two weekends at neighboring Cinema 21. Nearly twenty years after the death of Andy Warhol, the Gypsy held a birthday party in his honor in 2006. One Oregonian contributor called Gypsy a \"fitting setting\" for the celebration, given its lava lamps and blue and orange fishbowl drinks, which he said were \"like Pop art through a straw\". Gypsy partnered with Cinema 21 in 2009 when the theater hosted \"Can't Stop the Serenity\", a benefit for Equality Now that included two screenings of the film Serenity (2005). Festivities included a costume contest, pub quiz, and Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog karaoke. Pub Quiz USA hosted an \"All 'Lost' Trivia Night\" at the Gypsy in 2010 for fans of the television program Lost. Gypsy often screened episodes of Mad Men, the American television series set in the 1960s, and pay-per-view Ultimate Fighting Championship matches.\n\nIn an attempt to offer \"something different and exciting to do\", Gypsy began hosting goldfish racing tournaments in 2010. A chef who worked at Gypsy proposed hosting the tournaments after seeing videos of fish racing online. Two other establishments owned by Concept Entertainment also hosted goldfish races. Gypsy's cross-shaped track was 9 ft long and \"tricked out with fancy runway lights\". The tournaments prompted criticism by a local veterinarian and a spokesperson for the Oregon Humane Society, who suggested they \"may skirt the line of the humane society's guiding principle, which is to not inflict pain and suffering on animals for enjoyment\". The spokesperson also said, \"I do wish people could find different ways to entertain themselves.\"\n\nReception\n\nIn 2009, The NW Examiner included Gypsy in an article about happy hours in Northwest Portland. In her review, Desiree Andrews wrote that the fried artichoke hearts and pub chips were forgettable and recommended the black bean quesadilla. She said, \"Overall, the atmosphere was a little too much like a Big Lebowski hallucination for me, and the food triggered clogged-artery images, but the friendliness of the staff made up for a lot.\"",
  "Kaneko Kentar\u014d\n\nCount Kaneko Kentar\u014d (\u91d1\u5b50 \u5805\u592a\u90ce) was a statesman, diplomat, and legal scholar in Meiji period Japan. A graduate of Harvard Law School, he drew on his connections in the American legal community over the course of his long career in Japanese government, particularly in his role helping to draft the new Meiji Constitution.\n\nEarly life\n\nKaneko was born into a samurai family of Fukuoka Domain (Chikuzen Province's Sawara district, present-day Ch\u016b\u014d-ku, Fukuoka), being the son of Kaneko Naomichi (1821-1876), leader of the Ansei Expedition to the Philippines in 1855. At the age of 9, he began his studies at the Shuyukan Han school. At 19, he was selected as a student member of the Iwakura Mission, and journeyed to the United States. He remained there while the rest of the mission continued on to Europe, with the instruction to obtain an education in any subject. At first, seeking a naval career, he planned to attend the United States Naval Academy in Maryland, but a doctor assessed his physical fortitude as insufficient and discouraged any military pursuit. Instead, Kaneko decided to seek a legal education, enrolling at Harvard University in 1876. He prepared for the challenging curriculum by seeking out the personal tutelage of future Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. At Harvard, Kaneko shared lodgings with fellow Japanese student and future fellow-diplomat Komura Jutar\u014d. He also developed a wide circle of contacts in America, including lawyers, scientists, journalists, and industrialists.\n\nWhile at Harvard, Kaneko visited the apartments of Alexander Graham Bell and spoke on an experimental telephone with a fellow Japanese student, Izawa Shunji. According to Bell, this was the first instance of any language besides English being spoken into the new invention.\n\nAfter graduating from Harvard in 1878, Kaneko returned to Japan as a lecturer at the University of Tokyo.\n\nGovernment career\n\nIn 1880, Kaneko was appointed as a secretary in the Genr\u014din, and in 1884 had joined the Office for Investigation of Institutions, the body organized by the Genr\u014din to study the constitutions of various western nations with the aim of creating a western-style constitution for Japan. The Meiji Constitution that was the product of this committed was promulgated by the Emperor in 1889. Kaneko worked closely with It\u014d Hirobumi, Inoue Kowashi and It\u014d Miyoji, and became personal secretary to It\u014d Hirobumi when the latter became first Prime Minister of Japan. Kaneko was appointed to the House of Peers of the Diet of Japan in 1890, becoming its first secretary. He was subsequently appointed as Vice Minister, then briefly Minister of Agriculture and Commerce in 1898 in the third It\u014d administration. He was awarded an honorary doctorate (LL.D.) by Harvard in 1899 for his work on the Meiji Constitution.\n\nPerhaps influenced by his own experiences, Kaneko actively promoted the value and necessity of education. His childhood primary school, Shuyukan, having closed in 1871, Kaneko campaigned the Fukuoka regional government to reopen the school and raised funds in support. In 1885, it was reopened as an English vocational school, with all classes held in English. In 1889, Kaneko became the first president of Nihon Law School (now Nihon University), a post he held until 1893.\n\nIn 1891, Kaneko was elected to the prestigious Institute of International Law, traveling to its general meeting in Geneva the next year as part of his campaigning to revise the unequal treaties Japan had signed during its forced \"opening\" in the late 1850s.\n\nIn 1900, Kaneko was appointed as Minister of Justice under the fourth It\u014d administration and was made baron (danshaku) in the kazoku peerage system in 1907.\n\nRusso-Japanese War\n\nIn 1904, during the Russo-Japanese War, at the personal request of It\u014d Hirobumi, Kaneko returned to the United States as a special envoy from the Japanese government to enlist American diplomatic support in bringing the war to a speedy conclusion. Kaneko embarked on a public-relations blitz, publishing editorials in various periodicals and delivering speeches. In April 1904, Kaneko addressed the Japan Club of Harvard University, delivering the tailored message that Japan was fighting to maintain the peace of Asia and to conserve the influence of Anglo-American civilization in the East. While in the United States, Kaneko revived contacts with Theodore Roosevelt, with whom he had been contemporaneously at Harvard (though they did not meet until later, introduced by William Sturgis Bigelow in 1889), and requested that Roosevelt help Japan mediate a peace treaty. When Kaneko met Roosevelt, the president asked for a book that would help explain the character of the Japanese people\u2014what motivates them, their culture and spiritual education in Japan. Kaneko gave Roosevelt a copy of 'Bushido', and several months later, Roosevelt thanked Kaneko, remarking that it enlightened within him a deeper understanding of the Japanese culture and character. Thereafter, Roosevelt eagerly took on the task and presided over the subsequent Treaty of Portsmouth negotiations.\n\nLater career\n\nFrom 1906, Kaneko served as a member of the Privy Council, and was elevated in title to viscount (shishaku) in 1907.\n\nIn his later years he was engaged in the compilation of a history of the Imperial family and served as secretary general of the association for compiling historical materials about the Meiji Restoration. He completed an official biography of Emperor Meiji in 1915. He was awarded the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun in 1928, and elevated to hakushaku (count) in 1930.\n\nKaneko was a strong proponent of good diplomatic relations with the United States all of his life. In 1900, he established the first American Friendship Society (\u7c73\u53cb\u5354\u4f1a).\n\nAccording to the records of the America-Japan Society, Kentaro Kaneko founded that organization in Tokyo, in March 1917, and became its first president. In 1938, during a time of increasingly strident anti-American rhetoric from the Japanese government and press, he established the Japan-America Alliance Association (\u65e5\u7c73\u540c\u5fd7\u4f1a), a political association calling for a \"Japanese-American Alliance\", together with future Prime Minister Takeo Miki. He was one of the few senior statesmen in Japan to speak out strongly against war with the United States as late as 1941.\n\nOn his death in 1942, Kaneko was posthumously awarded the Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Chrysanthemum.",
  "Whitechapel Mount\n\nWhitechapel Mount was a large artificial mound of disputed origin. A prominent landmark in 18th century London, it stood in the Whitechapel Road beside the newly constructed London Hospital, being not only older, but significantly taller. It was crossed by tracks, served as a scenic viewing-point (and a hiding place for stolen goods), could be ascended by horses and carts, and supported some trees and formal dwelling-houses. It has been interpreted as: a defensive fortification in the English Civil War; a burial place for victims of the Great Plague; rubble from the Great Fire of London; and as a laystall (hence it was sometimes called Whitechapel Dunghill). Possibly all of these theories are true to some extent.\n\nWhitechapel Mount was physically removed around 1807. Because Londoners widely believed in the \"Great Fire rubble\" theory, the remains were sifted by antique hunters, and some sensational finds were claimed. It survives in its present-day placename Mount Terrace, E1.\n\nNeighbourhood\n\nWhitechapel Mount was on the south side of the Whitechapel Road, on the ancient route from the City of London to Mile End, Stratford, Colchester and Harwich. In the 18th century and later the surroundings were mostly fields: grazing for cows or market gardens.\n\nLeaving London, a traveller would pass the church of St Mary Matfelon (origin of the name \"white chapel\") on the right, then a windmill, before arriving at the Mount. Across the Whitechapel Road was a burying ground and the Ducking Pond. Further east, at the turnpike, the name changed to Mile End Road, with Dog Row (today Cambridge Heath Road) branching off to Bethnal Green.\n\nAccording to John Strype (1720) the neighbourhood was a busy one, with good inns for travellers in Whitechapel and good houses for sea captains in Mile End. Even so, said Strype, the Whitechapel Road was \"pestered\" by illegally built, poor quality dwellings.\n\nAnother source said it was infested by highwaymen, footpads and riff-raff of all kinds who preyed on travellers to and from London. News and court reports speak of murders and robberies. In two Old Bailey cases stolen property was buried in, and recovered from, Whitechapel Mount. It was a place of resort for pugilists and dog-fighters.\n\nFrom the summit of Whitechapel Mount an extensive view of the hamlets of Limehouse, Shadwell, and Ratcliff could be obtained.\n\nOn maps\n\nWhitechapel Mount's position is first depicted in a 1673 building plan by Sir Christopher Wren, where he refers to it as \"the mud wall called the Fort\". In Joel Gascoyne's survey of the parish of Stepney (1703) it is called The Dunghill: it is at least 400 yards long, and is crossed not only by a path, but a road.\n\nIn John Rocque's map of London (1746) it has been horizontally truncated, but is shown with substantial elevation, with at least one dwelling-house \u2013 if not a terrace of houses \u2013 on its western end. In Richard Blome's map of 1755 it has a large dwelling-house with front drive and appears alongside the newly built London Hospital. In John Cary's 1795 map its western portion has been truncated by the newly built New Road, but appears to have a substantial building in its northwest corner.\n\nCivil War fortification\n\nIn 1643 London was hastily fortified against the Royalist armies, for \"there is terrible news that [Prince] Rupert will sack it and so a complete and sufficient dike and earthern wall and bulwarks must be made\".\n\nTwenty-three or 24 earthen forts were built at intervals around the city and its main suburbs; neighbouring forts were in sight of one another. These forts were manned by volunteers e.g. men too old to be in the regular militia; local innkeepers were ordered to provide them with food.\n\nThe forts were interconnected by an earth bank and trench, dug by \"great numbers of men, women and young children\". All social classes joined in the labour:\n\nThe completed ring was 18 miles in circumference. A visiting Scotsman walked it; it took him 12 hours.\n\nFort No.2, officially a hornwork with two flanks, commanded the Whitechapel Road. The Scottish traveller, who inspected it, said it was a \"nine angled fort only pallosaded and single ditched and planted with seven pieces of brazen ordnance [brass cannon], and a court du guard [guardhouse] composed of timber and thatched with tyle stone as all the rest are\". There was a trench around its base.\n\nDaniel Lysons said the earthwork at Whitechapel was 329 foot long, 182 foot broad and more than 25 foot above ground level.\n\nAfter the civil war these fortifications were swiftly removed because they spoiled productive agricultural land. However traces remained and one of these was Whitechapel Mount. Wrote Lysons (1811): \"The east end was till of late years very perfect; on the west side some houses had been built. The surface on the top, except where it had been dug away, was perfectly level. Mount Street, Mayfair, is another relict name of one of these civil war forts.\n\nGreat Plague burial ground\n\nIn the bubonic epidemic of 1665 an estimated 70,000-100,000 Londoners died of the plague. Aldgate, Whitechapel and Stepney were badly affected. This placed a strain on the burial facilities and some were buried in mass graves.\n\nOfficial mass graves were made by opening a deep pit and leaving it open for as long as it took to fill with cadavers, which was done downwind. The number of lost plague pits in London is commonly exaggerated \u2014 most mass graves were actually in pre-existing churchyards. However there were some gaps in the records and \"undoubtedly some temporary and irregular plague burial sites\". Those willing to man the dead carts (and dispose of the corpses) were not fastidious; a contemporary said they were \u2018very idle base liveing men and very rude\", drawing attention to their task by swearing and cursing.\n\nNo contemporaneous record confirms corpses were officially buried in Whitechapel Mount. It is known that there were several burial grounds or plague pits in the vicinity e.g. across the road. Whether the mound was used as a burial ground has been disputed. According to popular tradition, it was. In one version, Whitechapel Mount's origin was that rubble from the Fire of London was thrown over a plague pit to cover it up. These rumours were denied by the authorities when they proposed to remove Whitechapel Mount; they had it \"pierced\" in an effort to refute them.\n\nThe clearest reputable source is the author Joseph Moser, who wrote \"In the course of last summer [1802], when part of the rubbish of [Whitechapel Mount] had just been removed, I had the curiosity to inspect the place, and observed in the different strata a great number of human bones, together with those, apparently, of different animals, oxen, or cows, and sheep\u2019s horns, bricks, tiles, &c. The bones and other exuvia of animals were in many places, especially towards the bottom, bedded in a stiff, viscid earth, of the blueish colour and consistence of potter's clay, which was unquestionably the original ground, thrown into different directions, as different interments operated upon its surface.\" A complication is that the London Hospital itself may have used the Mount for burials: a hospital history says that by 1764 \"The Mount Burying Ground was full\".\n\nGreat Fire detritus\n\nThe Great Fire of London occurred the year after the plague. The nearest burnt environment was a mile away. Even so, respectable sources asserted that Whitechapel Mount was formed or augmented from rubble from the Fire of London, including Dr Markham the rector of Whitechapel Church, who took pains to investigate the subject. This origin theory was widely believed, though some denied it. When the Mount was dismantled in the 19th century the belief attracted flocks of antique hunters; see below.\n\nLaystall\n\nThe above theories about the origin of Whitechapel Mount, by themselves, may not account for its sheer size as shown in the maps and illustrations cited.\n\nA laystall was an open rubbish tip; towns relied on them for disposing of garbage, and did so until the sanitary landfills of the 20th century. By legislation of October 1671 seven laystalls were appointed for the City of London. All street sweepings and household rubbish was to be collected in carts and had to be tipped in one of these, and nowhere else. One of them was Whitechapel Mount: it was to receive the rubbish from the wards of Portsoken, Tower, Duke's Place and Lime Street.\n\nHowever, a laystall was more than a passive tip: it was a business. Its proprietor employed gangs of men, women and boys to sort the rubbish and recycle it. Without him, nothing prevented indiscriminate fly-tipping and random lateral spread onto adjoining properties. William Guy who investigated the laystalls of mid-19th century London reported\n\n\"In most of the laystalls or dustmen's yards, every species of refuse matter is collected and deposited:",
  "Lloyd the Conqueror\n\nLloyd the Conqueror is a 2011 Canadian comedy film co-written by Andrew Herman and Michael Peterson and also directed by Michael Peterson. Evan Williams stars as Lloyd, a college student who is convinced by his professor Derek, played by Mike Smith to join his deteriorating Larping league.\n\nPlot\n\nLloyd the Conqueror is Lloyd, a lazy college student with big dreams for the future. Lloyd and his two best friends Patrick and Oswald desperately need to pass their Medieval Literature class in order to keep their financial aid. Our heroes are so desperate that they beg their teacher for extra credit work. Their professor, Derek, concedes but only on one condition: They must join his deteriorating LARPing league and battle against him in a game of Demons & Dwarves. Lloyd decides to enlist the help of Cassandra, ex-cage fighter and \"Self Defense for Women\" instructor in the battle against Derek, the long reigning champion who has been twisted to the dark side by his years of intense academic study.\n\nOn their quest to victory the three students must match wits with a pack of crazed Danes whose bloodlust is posted on-line to their LARPing victories, the muscle bound Leopold who comes out of the Sanitarium to beat Lloyd and friends at the game he takes a little too seriously, and the stuck up Science Fiction Larper who would sooner break the prime directive than cut our heroes some slack. The journey forces Lloyd and the boys to do some actual work for once including throwing \u2018magic\u2019 tinfoil balls, deciding which household items are most effective in slaying trolls, and questioning society's hero worship of George Washington Carver.",

She was promoted second from her first-round pool and again from her semi-final, losing both times to the Hungarian Erna Bogen-Bog\u00e1ti. In the final pool of nine she won six fights, but once again lost to Bogen, as well as to With (DEN); however, those two both lost three fights, leaving Neligan clear at the head of the table. At the same championships, she won a silver medal as part of the British women\u2019s team that came second to Hungary, a feat that was repeated the following year.\n\nNeligan reached the final of the European Championship three years in succession.

  "Tofta Church, Gotland\n\nTofta Church (Tofta kyrka) is a medieval church in Tofta on the Swedish island of Gotland. It belongs to the Church of Sweden and lies in the Diocese of Visby.\n\nHistory and architecture\n\nThe earliest church on this location was probably built during the end of the 12th century; of this first church however nothing remains. The oldest part of the presently visible church is the tower. The nave and choir both date from the middle of the 14th century. The church walls display fragments of medieval murals that were found during a restoration in 1958-1959. A few medieval stained glass windows are likewise preserved in the church.\n\nOf the furnishings, the baptismal font is the oldest, dating from the 12th century and richly sculpted. It was probably made for the earliest church. The high altar has a retable from the 14th century, probably made in L\u00fcbeck. Two other wooden sculptures from the same century are also preserved in the church, one of the Virgin Mary and one of St. Olaf. An unusually well-preserved medieval bench also stands in the church. In the floor of the choir is a gravestone, made for a farmer and his son who were beaten to death in 1340. The pews and the pulpit date from the Baroque era.\n\nIn 2004, an extremely well-preserved mail coif was discovered in a room in the tower during cleaning of the church. Reputedly it is one of the most well-preserved mail coif ever found in Europe, second only to a similar one displayed at the National Museum of Scotland. It may be connected to a civil war that was fought on the island in 1288. The mail coif is now displayed inside Tofta church.",

The stated ratio was that one Landsknecht in four would be a Doppels\u00f6ldner. The Doppels\u00f6ldner of each company were usually issued with ranged weapons, such as a crossbow or an arquebus, and arranged in the wings of a square, in front of the pikemen.\n\nLikewise, Landsknechte schooled in the use of the Zweih\u00e4nder (two-hander), a two-handed sword, were entitled to double pay and thus qualified as Doppels\u00f6ldner.

  "Altarpiece of the Halberd\n\nThe Altarpiece of the Halberd is a painting from around 1539 by the Italian High Renaissance painter Lorenzo Lotto. It is housed in the Pinacoteca civica Francesco Podesti of Ancona, central Italy.\n\nHistory\n\nThe work was seen by the art biographer Giorgio Vasari in the church of Sant'Agostino in Ancona, where Lotto had fled in reply to the hostility received in Venice. It was later moved to the church of Santa Maria della Piazza and, after other locations, the current one.\n\nThe painting dates to a few years after the coup by which Ancona had been restored to the Papal States. The resistance had been brutally suppressed, many of the rebels having been beheaded by order of the papal legate. The upside-down halberd has been thus interpreted as a symbol of peace.\n\nDescription\n\nThe monumental composition is taken directly from the tradition of Holy Conversations in the Venetian School, inaugurated by Antonello da Messina's San Cassiano Altarpiece. It shows the Madonna and Child on a high throne, with two angels holding the crown (a 15th-century Flemish painting element also in use in Italy). In the lower part are four saints: Stephen, John the Evangelist, Simon the Zealot and Lawrence. Simon is holding the halberd which gives its name to the altarpiece. At the sides of the throne, between columns and draperies, are two sections of sky with clouds.\n\nLike in other Lotto's works, the symmetry is broken by the variety of postures and gestures; the work is general characterized by a certain archaic style, explainable by the relatively provincial commissioners and the late stage of his career.",

  "Alexis de Tocqueville Institution\n\nThe Alexis de Tocqueville Institution (AdTI) was a Washington, D.C. based think tank.\n\nAdTI was named after the French historian Alexis de Tocqueville.

In 2006, the organization ceased most operations, issuing its last press release in 2007 to announce that its former chairman was running for President of the United States.\n\nIntellectual property studies\n\nThe AdTI published a series of studies beginning in 2002 on the theme of intellectual property in the software industry. The Institution authored Opening the Open Source Debate (June 2002), a report critical of Microsoft's open-source rivals. This report claimed that open source software was inherently less secure than proprietary software and hence a particular target for terrorists.\n\nThese studies culminated in Samizdat: And Other Issues Regarding the 'Source' of Open Source Code (prereleased May 2004), questioning the generally accepted provenance of Linux and other open source projects, and recommending that government-funded programming should never be licensed under the GNU General Public License but under the BSD license or similar licenses. While the book called for increased investment in open source development, it criticized what it called \"hybrid\" source models, in which true open source code is mixed with proprietary code, with the result that intellectual property rights are nullified.\n\nTo illustrate potential problems with this approach, the book cited the case of Linus Torvalds, creator of Linux. It claimed Torvalds used source code taken from Minix, a small Unix-like operating system used in teaching computer science, to create Linux 0.01, on the theory that no mere student could write an entire Unix-like kernel single-handedly\u2014although writing a kernel of similar size and capabilities is a standard part of many computer science degrees. These claims have been seriously questioned, including by many of those quoted in support, such as Andrew S. Tanenbaum, author of Minix; Dennis Ritchie, one of the creators of Unix; and Richard Stallman, leader of the GNU project. Others have said that quotes attributed as being from an \"interview with AdTI\" were in fact from prerelease papers (Ilkka Tuomi) or from message board posts (Charles Mills, Henry Jones). Alexey Toptygin said he had been commissioned by Brown to find similarities between Minix and Linux 0.01 source code, and found no support for the theory that Minix source code had been used to create Linux; this study is not mentioned in the book.\n\nIt cited a number of arguments for the claim, including an email from Tanenbaum saying MINIX \"was the base\" Torvalds used to create Linux. Tanenbaum later published a refutation of the book's interpretation, wherein he recounted an interview with Ken Brown while the latter was researching the book, during which Tanenbaum had emphatically stated his belief that Torvalds wrote Linux single-handedly and provided examples of other people or small teams who had performed similar feats in the past.\n\nThe AdTI was preparing a new study in November 2004, tentatively titled Intellectual Property Left, to argue that \"the IT industry sector's reluctance to pursue rampant IP infringement against public domain software developers and users is going to precipitate billions of dollars in balance sheet downgrades by Wall Street.\" The later papers stand in contrast to the Institution's 2000 paper, The Market Place Should Rule on Technology, which discusses Linux as a direct competitor to Microsoft Windows.\n\nOther publications\n\nThe AdTI produced a number of papers on education policy.\n\nWhen the B-2 bomber program was threatened in 1995, the AdTI organised a letter to President Bill Clinton signed by seven former Pentagon chiefs: Dick Cheney, Caspar Weinberger, Frank Carlucci, Harold Brown, James Schlesinger, Donald Rumsfeld and Melvin Laird.\n\nThe AdTI published Newt Gingrich's 2003 book, Saving Lives & Saving Money: Transforming Health and Healthcare.\n\nAdTI was a member organization of the Cooler Heads Coalition which asserts that \"the science of global warming is uncertain\" and is focused on \"dispelling the myths of global warming by exposing flawed economic, scientific, and risk analysis\".\n\nFunding\n\nMicrosoft had been one of the Institution's backers for five years, although a Microsoft spokesman said they had not funded any specific research.",

  "All India Anglo-Indian Association\n\nThe All India Anglo-Indian Association is an organisation representing the interests of Anglo-Indians. It was founded in 1926 in colonial India by Sir Henry Gidney. It has sixty-two branches in all of India.\n\nThe All India Anglo-Indian Association holds that Anglo-Indians are unique in that they are Christians, speak English as their mother tongue, as well as have a historical link to both Europe and India. During the era of the British Raj in India, the then president of the All-India Anglo-Indian Association represented the Anglo-Indian community of undivided India at the Round Table Conferences. At the time of the Indian independence movement, the All-India Anglo-Indian Association opposed the partition of India; its then president Frank Anthony \"fought for the best interests of his community as Indians, not Britishers,\" criticizing the British for \"racial discrimination in matters of pay and allowances, and for failing to acknowledge the sterling military and civil contributions made by Anglo-Indians to the Raj\". In September 1942, at the organisation's annual general meeting, the All India Anglo-Indian Association affirmed its love for and loyalty to India. The organisation's efforts under the presidency of Anthony led to Article 331 being included in the Constitution of India: \"Notwithstanding anything in Article 170, the Governor of a State may, if he is of opinion that the Anglo-Indian community needs representation in the Legislative Assembly of the State and is not adequately represented therein, [nominate one member of that community to the Assembly].\"\n\nThe various branches of the All India Anglo-Indian Association arrange events throughout the year. This includes celebrations of Christian holidays such as Christmas, as well as sporting events with an annual hockey tournament being at the epicentre.",

  "Lithuanian Nationalist Union\n\nThe Lithuanian Nationalist Union (Lietuvi\u0173 tautinink\u0173 s\u0105junga or LTS), also known as the Nationalists (Tautininkai), was the ruling political party in Lithuania during the authoritarian regime of President Antanas Smetona from 1926 to 1940. The party was established in 1924 but was not popular. It came to power as a result of the December 1926 military coup. From 1927 to 1939, the Council of Ministers included only members of the LTS. In 1936, other parties were officially disbanded leaving LTS the only legal party in the country. At the end of the 4th decade new members started coming and bringing new ideas, which were right wing and closer to the Italian Fascism. The party was disestablished after the Soviet occupation of Lithuania in June 1940. The party under the same name (known as the Lithuanian Nationalist and Republican Union since 2017) was reestablished in 1990 and claims to be the successor of interwar LTS.\n\nHistory\n\nThe party was established during a conference in \u0160iauliai on 17\u201319 August 1924 as a merger of the Party of National Progress (established in 1916) and the Lithuanian Farmers' Association (established in 1919). The party did not enjoy popular support and in the May 1926 parliamentary elections won only 3 seats out of 85. However, its leaders Antanas Smetona and Augustinas Voldemaras were popular and influential public figures. The party was conservative and nationalistic; it stressed the need for a strong army and a strong leader.\n\nDuring the December 1926 coup, the military deposed the democratically elected government and invited Smetona to become the new President of Lithuania and Voldemaras the new Prime Minister. The Nationalists and the Lithuanian Christian Democrats formed a new government. However, the relationship between the two parties soon became tense as Christian Democrats regarded the coup as a temporary measure and wished to hold new elections to the Seimas. In April 1927, Smetona dissolved the Seimas and Christian Democrats resigned from the government in May. New elections to Seimas were not called until 1936. The Nationalists remained the only party in the government until a political crisis after the German ultimatum regarding Klaip\u0117da Region forced LTS to admit two members of the opposition to the Council of Ministers.\n\nVoldemaras established Iron Wolf (Gele\u017einis Vilkas) as the paramilitary wing of the Nationalists. In September 1929, Smetona removed Voldemaras from the office of prime minister and installed his co-brother-in-law Juozas T\u016bbelis. The new constitutions of 1928 and 1938 established a presidential dictatorship. Political opponents were suppressed. In preparation for the June 1936 election, other political parties were banned leaving LTS the only legal party in Lithuania. In 1930s, the party became increasingly more radical and sympathetic to the Italian Fascism.\n\nMajor periodicals published by the party included Lietuvis (1924\u201328), Lietuvos aidas (1928\u201340), M\u016bs\u0173 kra\u0161tas (1930\u201333), and Vairas (1914\u201340).",

The speed that you do that; the clarity, the cleanness... not only are you\u2013 obviously you're funny, but everybody knows that. And obviously you're likeable, everybody knows that.

  "Govan Mbeki\n\nGovan Archibald Mvuyelwa Mbeki (9 July 1910 \u2013 30 August 2001) was a South African politician, military commander, Communist leader who served as the Secretary of Umkhonto we Sizwe, at its inception in 1961. He was also the son of Chief Sikelewu Mbeki and Johanna Mahala and also the father of the former South African president Thabo Mbeki and political economist Moeletsi Mbeki. He was a leader of the South African Communist Party and the African National Congress. After the Rivonia Trial, he was imprisoned (1963\u20131987) on charges of terrorism and treason, together with Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu, Raymond Mhlaba, Ahmed Kathrada and other eminent ANC leaders, for their role in the ANC's armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK). He was sometimes mentioned by his nickname \"Oom Gov\".\n\nEarly years\n\nGovan Mbeki was born in the Nqamakwe district of the Transkei region and was a part of the Xhosa ethnic group. As a teenager, Mbeki worked as a newsboy and messenger in the cities, and because of this, he saw the poverty urban black Africans lived in, and the constant police raids they endured. He attended Fort Hare University, completing in 1936 a Bachelor of Arts degree in politics and psychology and a teaching diploma. Mbeki met other African struggle leaders while attending the university.\n\nTeacher, trader and communist\n\nFor a time Mbeki worked as a teacher, but lost his job because of his political activities. He was a member of the South African Communist Party (SACP, then the Communist Party of South Africa, or CPSA) from the late 1930s, and joined the African National Congress in 1935. He then set up a co-operative store in Idutywa and began a writing career. From 1938 to 1944 he was the editor of Territorial Magazine / Inkundla Ya Bantu.\n\nMbeki left journalism in 1944 and became a government-nominated member of the Transkei Territorial Authorities General Council until 1950. His role in the CPSA/ SACP was clandestine at the time, which helps explain why he received the nomination. Mbeki disparagingly referred to the council as a 'toy telephone': \"You can say what you like, but your words have no effect because the wires are not connected to an exchange\". In 1948 Mbeki stood as a candidate for the Natives Representative Council but lost the election.\n\nWhen the CPSA/ SACP was banned in 1950 by the apartheid government, Mbeki remained in the African National Congress (ANC). In 1952 Mbeki was imprisoned together with Raymond Mhlaba and Vuyisile Mini for three months in Rooi Hel ('Red Hell' or North End Prison, Port Elizabeth) for disobeying apartheid laws by participating in the 'Campaign of Defiance against Injustice Laws' (Defiance Campaign). In 1954, a tornado destroyed his store, and Mbeki was dismissed from teaching again (he would lose his job three times, and be blacklisted from others, from the 1930s onwards). Mbeki moved to Port Elizabeth and joined the editorial board of New Age, a prominent leftist newspaper linked to underground CPSA/ SACP networks. Mbeki played a crucial role in ensuring that the pages and columns reflected the conditions, demands, and aspirations of black working-class people, particularly in the countryside.\n\nHe also worked on the Guardian, New Age, Fighting Talk and Liberation, and worked with 'Jock' Harold Strachan in the Port Elizabeth area, and helped him produce the newsletter Izwe Lomzi (\"Voice of the People\"). Mbeki was meanwhile actively involved in the major campaigns of the day, including the revival of the African National Congress in the 1940s, the Defiance Campaign and the Congress of the People.\n\nArmed struggle and Robben Island\n\nIn 1960, the ANC was banned, and along with the underground SACP, formed Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), which became ANC's armed wing. Mbeki was involved, and, at his urging, Strachan assisted MK by turning his hand to improvised explosive devices based on substances like potassium permanganate, magnesium, glycerol and icing sugar.\n\n\"...this was our job \u2013 devices and explosives. So I said, for God\u2019s sake, why me? And they said, no well, you were a bomber pilot in the war, you see, so you must know how to make bombs. I said, but for Christ\u2019s sake, Govan, (Mbeki) we didn\u2019t make our own bombs. And they said, but you know about those things and I said, no, bombs were made in bloody factories, I don\u2019t know. So he said, anyway, you\u2019re appointed. We did a good job, actually.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in November 1962, the then-Minister of Justice, John Vorster, banned New Age. When the editorial board came out with its successor publication Spark, Vorster went one step further by banning not the newspaper but its editors and writers. This effectively ended Mbeki's role as editor and journalist in the country. On 11 July 1963, he was arrested with other MK high commanders. In 1964, he was an accused in the Rivonia Trial and sentenced to Robben Island.\n\nBooks\n\nIn 1939, Mbeki published his first book, Transkei in the Making. A supporter of the 1950-1961 Pondoland peasant revolt, he wrote the pioneering study of the movement, South Africa: The Peasants' Revolt from 1958, which was published in 1964. Much of the book is an analysis of the political economy of the Transkei, rather than the revolt itself.\n\nFollowing the Rivonia Trial, Mbeki served a long-term on Robben Island, during which he managed to run education classes with prisoners, many on Marxist theory, and wrote a number of significant analyses jail, which were kept on the island and used for discussions. The surviving copies have since been published.\n\nIn 1992, he published The Struggle For Liberation in South Africa: A Short History and in 1996, Sunset at Midday: Latshonilangemini!\n\nRelease and post-apartheid role\n\nMbeki was released from custody after serving 24 years in the Robben Island prison on 5 November 1987. He served in South Africa's post-apartheid Senate from 1994 to 1997 as Deputy President of the Senate, and then the Senate's successor, the National Council of Provinces, from 1997 to 1999.\n\nMbeki died in Port Elizabeth on 30 August 2001. He was given state funeral during his son's presidency (Thabo) on 8 September 2001. His remains were the subject of controversy in 2006 when plans were made to exhume them, and place them in a museum. These plans were called off after Mbeki's family refused the request.\n\nAwards and honours\n\nMbeki received an honorary doctorate in the Social Sciences from the University of Amsterdam in 1978. His son Moeletsi attended the ceremony, as Mbeki was imprisoned at Robben Island.\n\nOn 26 June 1980, the Secretary General of the then-illegal African National Congress, Alfred Nzo, announced the conferring of the Isitwalandwe Medal, the ANC's highest honour, on Mbeki. Mbeki was, however, not present to receive the award, because he was serving a life imprisonment sentence on Robben Island.\n\nMbeki received international recognition for his political achievements including the renaming (at Mandela's suggestion) of the recently opened health building at Glasgow Caledonian University. The Govan Mbeki Health Building was inaugurated in 2001 at a ceremony featuring his son Thabo.\n\nThe Govan Mbeki Local Municipality in Mpumulanga is named in his honour.\n\nIn 2004 he was voted 97th in the SABC 3's Great South Africans.\n\nIn 2013 a large section of road between Swartklip and Baden Powell Road, running between the neighborhoods of Browns Farm, Gugulethu, Nyanga and Crossroads in Cape Town was renamed Govan Mbeki Road.",

  "\u010cSD Class T478.3\n\nT478.3 is a class of locomotives built for Czechoslovak State Railways to replace the most powerful steam locomotives (such as 477.0, 475.1 or 498.1) in heavy passenger and freight service. Their design is based on the type T478.1; the main difference is the new, more powerful V12 diesel engine.\n\nHistory\n\nIn the 1960s, the number of powerful diesel locomotives for mainline service in the former Czechoslovakia was still insufficient. The T478.1 class performed well, but they were less powerful than the heaviest passenger steam locomotives. The new type of locomotive was to be equipped with a V12 diesel engine of a newly developed class with 230 mm bore. The new engine was able to run at higher RPM and thus develop more power at the output of the traction generator at high locomotive speeds than the older designs. The engines were expected to be produced in I6, I8, V12 and V16 configuration with as much as 2 817 kW power output. Only the I6 and V12 configuration entered mass production. I8 was made only as a prototype, V16 was never produced.\n\nThe first two prototypes of the T478.3 class, T478.3001 and 3002, were finished in the middle of 1968 and were immediately put into heavy testing. The first prototype had a prototype diesel with 220 mm bore, which was soon replaced with a new one with standard 230 mm bore, set to 1470 kW output power. The gear ratio of the traction motors was modified and the maximum speed increased to 120 km/h. These modifications have shown excessive wear to the components and were removed after the end of the trials. The prototypes could be distinguished by the use of plain metal on the locomotive body. Corrugated metal was used on series production locomotives.\n\nThe pre-production series of ten locomotives was manufactured in 1970 and regular series were supplied since the end of 1971. The last locomotive was delivered in 1978.\n\nOperation\n\nThe new locomotives were immediately put into the most demanding operations, previously served by the most powerful steam locomotives. Soon, serious problems arose, mostly electric equipment flashovers and diesel engine failures. The situation was so bad that some of the already withdrawn steam locomotives had to be put back into service. For this reason, regular passenger steam services continued until 1978. After some modifications, the T478.3 became reliable, although they required more thorough maintenance than the older T478.1. in 1988, the numbering system changed and the locomotives were assigned Class 753.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1990s, the \u010cSD decided to switch from steam train heating to the much more convenient electric heating. The only diesel locomotives capable of the electric heating were the 754 class. It was decided to rebuild some of the steam-heating diesels to electric heating. Since 1991, 163 machines of the Class 753 had been equipped with an electric heating alternator instead of the steam generator and renumbered to Class 750. The locomotives kept their operating numbers. The steam heating has not been used since the end of the 1990s and the remaining locomotives of the original class continued to be used in freight transport.\n\nAs the electrification of the rail network proceeded, the need for powerful diesel locomotives decreased and the rail operator preferred the less powerful, but more rugged and fuel-efficient 751 class. Since the 1990s, the 753 class has been gradually withdrawn both in the Czech Republic and Slovakia and either reconstructed, stored for future use or scrapped. Since 2011, only a single locomotive of the original class, 753.301, remained in regular operations of the national freight operator \u010cD Cargo. As of April 2020, it is still operational and used in freight service in northeastern Bohemia. A few other non-reconstructed locomotives, including the first prototype, are preserved as museum units.\n\nClass 750\n\nSince 1991, 163 locomotives of the original class have been equipped with 3000 V electric train heating generator to satisfy the growing need for head-end power for new passenger cars. The locomotives received numerous other modifications to enhance their reliability and performance. Many of them have had their bogies modified to a new type of main frame suspension. As the network electrification continued, the demand for the locomotives soon decreased. Some of the locomotives have been withdrawn after a few years of service. Czech Railways have withdrawn the last locomotive from the passenger service in 2014. As of April 2020, some units of this class are still in use in freight transport by \u010cD Cargo and some private operators. The Slovak national operator \u017delezni\u010dn\u00e1 spolo\u010dnos\u0165 Slovensko uses a few of them in passenger service.\n\nClass 755 (\u017dSR)\n\nAn outstanding reconstruction has been performed on a single locomotive in the middle of the 1990s in Slovakia. The locomotive received an entirely new composite body, a Pielstick 12 PA 4 - 185 engine set to 1470 kW, a traction alternator and rectifier and a new control system. The whole project has been plagued by corruption reaching the top government officials. The locomotive has never been put into a fully operational order and after few trials, the whole project has been cancelled. The locomotive has been kept in storage until today.\n\nClass 752 (Czech Rep.), D 752 (Italy)\n\nIn 1996, one locomotive of the original 753 class has been fitted with a K 6 S 310 DR engine recovered from a withdrawn 770/771 locomotive and assigned Class 752. The aim was to replace the troublesome K 12 V 230 DR engine with a less powerful, but more reliable design. After 2000, 9 more locomotives have been supplied to private freight operators in Italy. Four more have been delivered to a Czech private freight company. The reconstruction has not been very successful and no more locomotives have been modified in this way.\n\nClass 755, 753.7 (Czech Rep.), 756 (ZSSK), D 753 (Italy)\n\nSince 2001 until 2011, 106 locomotives of both the original 753 and 750 classes have been extensively rebuilt using a new Caterpillar 3512 B DI-TA engine and a new electronic control system. The first 31 pieces have been sold to private freight operators in Italy. More orders were placed by Czech freight operators, both private and state-owned. Ten locomotives have been reconstructed in the same way in Slovakia.\n\nClass 750.7 (\u010cD), 757 (ZSSK)\n\nSince 2010, reconstructions similar to the 753.7 class, but equipped with an electric train heating generator, have been done in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. 19 locomotives have been delivered to Czech Railways and 25 to \u017delezni\u010dn\u00e1 spolo\u010dnos\u0165 Slovensko\n\nClass 753.6 (Czech Rep.)\n\nSince 2012, a reconstruction similar to the Class 753.7, but with an entirely new locomotive body, has been carried out on 18 locomotives for numerous freight operators in the Czech Republic.",

  "USS Hammerberg\n\nUSS Hammerberg (DE-1015), a, was a ship of the United States Navy named for Navy diver Francis P. Hammerberg (1920&ndash;1945), of Flint, Michigan, who was awarded the Medal of Honor posthumously for rescuing two fellow divers from a wreck in Pearl Harbor.\n\nHammerberg was launched 20 August 1954 by Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine, sponsored by Mrs. Elizabeth Moss; and commissioned 2 March 1955.\n\nBased at Naval Station Newport Rhode Island, Hammerberg participated in convoy exercises, trained students at the Fleet Sonar School, Key West, and conducted antisubmarine warfare exercises during her first 2\u00bd years of service.\n\n1950s\n\nHammerberg departed Newport 3 September 1957 to participate in maneuvers with units of NATO. Antisubmarine training in the Irish Sea was followed by visits to Plymouth, England and Brest, France, before the destroyer escort returned to Newport 21 October. Then, after hunter-killer exercises with the aircraft carrier USS Tarawa (CVS-40), Hammerberg sailed from Newport 1 April 1958 to Bod\u00f8, Norway, to take part in combined exercises with the Royal Norwegian Navy. She returned to Boston 14 May.\n\nDuring August and September 1958, the Hammerberg was part of Navy Task Force 88 (TF-88), during Operation Argus, which was involved in conducting nuclear tests in the very high atmosphere.\n\nDeparting Newport 27 January 1959, Hammerberg sailed to Guantanamo Bay for refresher training, then took part in antisubmarine warfare training with the navies of Chile and Peru. She returned to Newport 21 April.\n\n1960s, including the Cuban Missile Crisis\n\nBetween May 1959 and February 1960, Hammerberg was busy with antisubmarine exercises interspersed with cruises to Newfoundland and Puerto Rico. In March and April, she participated in Amphibious operations at Onslow Beach, N.C., and deployed 23 August 1960 for her second South American cruise. Hammerberg returned to Newport 13 December.\n\nHammerberg departed Newport 7 August 1961 on her third South American cruise. In November, at the request of the Organization of American States (OAS), Hammerberg and other American ships patrolled offshore the Dominican Republic to help ensure the orderly change over of that government and check Communist influence. Hammerberg returned to Newport 1 December.\n\nDuring 1962, Hammerberg participated in convoy escort operations and operated with the Fleet Sonar School in Key West. On 7 November, Hammerberg was en route south to NS Mayport, Fla., where she was diverted to patrol the Florida Coast during the Cuban Missile Crisis. On 29 November, after President John F. Kennedy had resolved the Cuban Crisis, she sailed for Newport, R.I., for a well-deserved rest and tender availability.\n\n1963 found Hammerberg in the Boston Naval Shipyard. From June to November, she devoted time to \"Unites IV\"\u2014a deployment which was to comprise the circumnavigation of South America in the conduct of ASW operations with seven South American navies. On 30 November, Hammerberg preceded to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for participation in \"PHIBASWEX I-63\", a large-scale amphibious, ASW operation with over 30 other units of the Atlantic Fleet. On 17 December, she arrived Newport, R.I.\n\nDuring 1964, Hammerberg participated in Operations \"Springboard\", \"Canus Silex\", and \"Steel Pike\", all exercises to sharpen the ship and crew not only in her important mission of locating and destroying submarines, but also in patrol, escort, rescue, evacuation, blockade and surveillance assignments.\n\nOn 8 February 1965, Hammerberg got underway for Northern Europe to join NATO \"Match Maker I\" Squadron in Exercise \"Pilot High\". On 3 May, the squadron left Lisbon for Operation \"Pole Star\" off Halifax, Nova Scotia. After return to Newport 20 July, Hammerberg went into repair at Boston Naval Shipyard. She then trained off Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and in August 1966 rendezvoused with escort USS Van Voorhis (DE-1028), guided missile frigate USS Leahy (DLG-16) and submarine USS Requin (SS-481) off Trinidad to participate in Operation \"Unitas VII\" through November.\n\nIn late March while serving plane guard duty astern of USS Essex (CVS 9), Hammerberg attempted to rescue the crew of a downed SH3A Sikorsky Sea King helicopter. The rescue attempt was unsuccessful, with the loss of 3 crew.\n\nIn April 1967, Hammerberg participated in operation \"Clove Hitch III\", a joint armed forces amphibious assault exercise in the Caribbean, with liberty ports in San Juan and St. Thomas, returning to Newport on 2 May. In June, Hammerberg departed for a NATO operation \"Newlook\" off Nova Scotia in which ships from the Netherlands, Canada, and the United Kingdom participated. At the completion of Newlook, and liberty in Halifax, Hammerberg proceeded to New York City for liberty on the weekend of 17 June. On 28 June, Hammerberg moved to Davisville, RI for 6 days of drydock to install a new screw and do minor hull repairs.\n\nIn late September, Hammerberg deployed for the Mediterranean as part of a \"Hunter-Killer\" group operation consisting of several destroyers/destroyer escorts and the USS Randolph (CVS-15). Liberty ports included Barcelona, Naples, Palma Majorca, and Gibraltar. Hammerberg returned to Newport in mid-December.\n\nFate\n\nHammerberg was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register 14 December 1973. She was sold for scrapping 14 June 1974.",
  "Supernova remnant\n\nA supernova remnant (SNR) is the structure resulting from the explosion of a star in a supernova. The supernova remnant is bounded by an expanding shock wave, and consists of ejected material expanding from the explosion, and the interstellar material it sweeps up and shocks along the way.\n\nThere are two common routes to a supernova: either a massive star may run out of fuel, ceasing to generate fusion energy in its core, and collapsing inward under the force of its own gravity to form a neutron star or a black hole; or a white dwarf star may accrete material from a companion star until it reaches a critical mass and undergoes a thermonuclear explosion.\n\nIn either case, the resulting supernova explosion expels much or all of the stellar material with velocities as much as 10% the speed of light (or approximately 30,000 km/s). These speeds are highly supersonic, so a strong shock wave forms ahead of the ejecta. That heats the upstream plasma up to temperatures well above millions of K. The shock continuously slows down over time as it sweeps up the ambient medium, but it can expand over hundreds or thousands of years and over tens of parsecs before its speed falls below the local sound speed.\n\nOne of the best observed young supernova remnants was formed by SN 1987A, a supernova in the Large Magellanic Cloud that was observed in February 1987. Other well-known supernova remnants include the Crab Nebula; Tycho, the remnant of SN 1572, named after Tycho Brahe who recorded the brightness of its original explosion; and Kepler, the remnant of SN 1604, named after Johannes Kepler. The youngest known remnant in our galaxy is G1.9+0.3, discovered in the galactic center.\n\nStages\n\nAn SNR passes through the following stages as it expands:\n\nTypes of supernova remnant\n\nThere are three types of supernova remnant:\n\nRemnants which could only be created by significantly higher ejection energies than a standard supernova are called hypernova remnants, after the high-energy hypernova explosion that is assumed to have created them.\n\nOrigin of cosmic rays\n\nSupernova remnants are considered the major source of galactic cosmic rays. The connection between cosmic rays and supernovas was first suggested by Walter Baade and Fritz Zwicky in 1934. Vitaly Ginzburg and Sergei Syrovatskii in 1964 remarked that if the efficiency of cosmic ray acceleration in supernova remnants is about 10 percent, the cosmic ray losses of the Milky Way are compensated. This hypothesis is supported by a specific mechanism called \"shock wave acceleration\" based on Enrico Fermi's ideas, which is still under development.\n\nIn 1949, Fermi proposed a model for the acceleration of cosmic rays through particle collisions with magnetic clouds in the interstellar medium. This process, known as the \"Second Order Fermi Mechanism\", increases particle energy during head-on collisions, resulting in a steady gain in energy. A later model to produce Fermi Acceleration was generated by a powerful shock front moving through space. Particles that repeatedly cross the front of the shock can gain significant increases in energy. This became known as the \"First Order Fermi Mechanism\".\n\nSupernova remnants can provide the energetic shock fronts required to generate ultra-high energy cosmic rays. Observation of the SN 1006 remnant in the X-ray has shown synchrotron emission consistent with it being a source of cosmic rays. However, for energies higher than about 1018 eV a different mechanism is required as supernova remnants cannot provide sufficient energy.\n\nIt is still unclear whether supernova remnants accelerate cosmic rays up to PeV energies. The future telescope CTA will help to answer this question.",
  "Sistema Nacional de Investigadores\n\nSistema Nacional de Investigadores (National System of Researchers) or SNI is a governmental agency established in Mexico in 1984 to promote both the quantity and quality of research in Mexico, especially in the sciences. In the 1980s, the country suffered from \u201cbrain drain,\u201d with talent leaving Mexico for better economic opportunities in other places in the world. SNI first worked to establish compensation guides to keep researchers in the country, but since has also been involved in the reform of Mexico\u2019s graduate-level education. Membership in the system is prestigious, especially in Levels II, III, and Emeritus, which require demonstration of significant contributions in research as well as teaching and the promotion of research in Mexico.\n\nThe organization\n\nThe Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National System of Researchers) is a governmental agency which promotes and evaluates professional research activity in Mexico. Its objective is to promote and strengthen the quantity and quality of research in Mexico through the evaluation of the work done. It promotes the interests of researchers through social and political work. It is a subsidiary of the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda (CONACYT) and an integral part of the Sistema de Educaci\u00f3n Superior y Cient\u00edfico in Mexico. The organization has been key in representing academia to the federal government. It works to increase the number of active researchers in Mexico, both by the creation and retention of prominent researchers as well as working to link research to teaching quality in higher education, with a particular focus on the hard sciences. The organization also offers research grants, which as of 2009 totaled over two billion pesos.\n\nIt is a cornerstone of the higher education system in the country, and is authorized to rank both research and researchers. The prestige of membership in the system has no equal in Mexico, and most of Mexico\u2019s universities and research institutions have links to the organization. However, the organization has been criticized in the 2000s. One criticism of the organization is that it has replaced universities in the function of evaluating research in Mexico. However, most institutions of higher education in Mexico accept the organization\u2019s evaluations. Another is that the system gives insufficient or no recognition to the work involved in teaching and the diffusion of research results (conferences, etc.). It also does not create a distinction between those in the physical and social sciences or humanities even though they have different ways of working.\n\nMembership\n\nEvaluation of members and potential members mostly relies on their academic credentials and production but also includes other factors such as the creation of programs and projects. To become and remain a member of the SNI, researchers must show a history of systematic research in their fields, done as part of their employment with a university or research institution and duly documented. At least twenty hours per week must be spent in research if in Mexico or work must be completely research related if abroad. Researchers are evaluated through the publication of articles, books, research results and book chapters as well as patents, technological innovations and technology transfer, if applicable. Other areas for evaluation include the direction of professional and post-graduate theses, the teaching of undergraduate and graduate courses and the formation of new researchers and research groups.\n\nThere are two main categories, Candidate and National Researcher (Investigador Nacional), with the latter divided into Level I, Level II, Level III and National Researcher Emeritus (Investigador Nacional Em\u00e9rito ). In order to be admitted as members, applicants must hold a doctoral degree, demonstrate the ability to perform original research in their fields, and must have finished their bachelors not more than fifteen years prior to the application date (although exceptions are made in the last requirement). For Level I, the researcher must also show work in the direction of theses and the teaching of undergraduate and graduate courses as well as show evidence of the creation of knowledge in their fields. For Level II, in addition to the previous requisites the research output must be recognized as that of a leader in the field with its quality being assessed by senior members of the System. Graduate level thesis direction and/or other forms of post-baccalaureate mentoring are also required. Level III is reserved for those researchers who have made significant contributions to their fields in Mexico. All levels are subject to periodic re-evaluation, except for Emeritus, which is for life.\n\nLess than half of all researchers in the country are members, and most of the members are concentrated at the grades of Candidate and Level I. Mexican researchers that work abroad and are SNI members do not receive an economical incentive, and their membership is considered as an academic distinction. In recent years, the organization has had difficulty in recruiting younger researchers. Most members, just over fifty percent are in the Mexico City area, with other concentrations of researchers in Baja California, Guanajuato, Hidalgo, State of Mexico, Jalisco, Michoac\u00e1n, Morelos, Nuevo Le\u00f3n, Puebla, San Luis Potos\u00ed, Sonora and Veracruz.\n\nHistory\n\nThe idea for the organization began in 1982, when the then economic crisis of the country decimated salaries for researchers, prompting many to leave the country to find opportunities. Its initial promoters include Jorge Flores, Salvador Malo and Jos\u00e9 Sarukh\u00e1n, along with Jes\u00fas Reyes Heroles (then head of the Secretar\u00eda de Educaci\u00f3n P\u00fablica) and President Miguel de la Madrid.\n\nThe outline of the organization was laid out in an October 1983 meeting of the Academia Mexicana de Ciencias (then the Academia de la Investigaci\u00f3n Cient\u00edfica) in Oaxtepec, Morelos. The organization was approved by Mexico\u2019s president in December 1983 with the first meeting of the executive committee convened in August 1984. Its first priorities were to select the first round of members and then establish salaries for researchers that would counter the effects of \u201cbrain drain.\u201d\n\nSince its initial formation it has experienced reforms and adjustments to its organization and evaluation criteria, most notably in 1986, 1988, 1993 and 1995. During this time it was part of CONACYT\u2019s larger program to reforming post-graduate study in the country, which suffered from low standards and quality.\n\nThe organization has grown from its initial 1,200 members to more than 35,000 (2021). It has affected how post graduate study is accredited in Mexico and has been instrumental in the formation of public policies towards research in Mexico, especially in the sciences. However, after twenty five years, there has been institutional fatigue and other issues presented by changing technologies and other challenges in higher education. Mexico still struggles to compete internationally in research. There is still a severe shortage of researchers in the sciences in Mexico as there are only 0.5 researchers per 100,000 economically active people, a rate similar to that of Guatemala and less than that of Argentina. As of 2011, Mexico ranked 35th, behind Brazil, South Africa and China in research activity. Most research activity is concentrated in peer-reviewed articles rather than the economically more important generation of patents.",

  "Nieuport IV\n\nThe Nieuport IV was a French-built sporting, training and reconnaissance monoplane of the early 1910s.\n\nDesign and development\n\nSociete Anonyme des Etablissements Nieuport was formed in 1909 by \u00c9douard Nieuport. The Nieuport IV was a development of the single-seat Nieuport II and two seat Nieuport III.A. It was initially designed as a two-seat sporting and racing monoplane, but was also bought by the air forces of several countries. It was initially powered by a 50 hp Gnome Omega rotary engine, which was later replaced by more powerful rotaries.\n\nOperational history\n\nThe first Nieuport IVs were built in 1911 and production continued well into World War I in Russia. The design was adopted in small numbers by most air arms of the period, although the Imperial Russian Air Service was the largest user.\n\nThe IV.G was one of the principal aircraft used by the Imperial Russian Air Service during its formative years, with roughly 300 being produced locally by the Russo-Baltic Wagon Works and Shchetinin in St. Petersburg, and the Dux Factory in Moscow. Lt. Pyotr Nesterov performed the first ever loop, over Kiev in a model IV.G on 27 August 1913 for which he was placed under arrest for 10 days for \"undue risk to government property\" until the feat was repeated in France and he was promoted and awarded a medal.\n\nThe French government equipped a single squadron with Nieuport IV.Ms, Escadrille N12 initially based at Reims, having purchased at least 10. This unit continued to operate Nieuport monoplanes after the start of World War I, slowly replacing them with other types as attrition reduced their numbers.\n\nThe Swedish Air Force was presented with a IV.G in 1912 by four individuals, becoming one of the first aircraft of that force, which was later joined by a second IV.G in 1913, and a IV.H transferred from the Swedish Navy.\n\nThe Japanese Army operated one IV.G and one IV.M, which were designated as Army Nieuport NG2 aeroplane and Army Nieuport NM aeroplane respectively, with the NG being flown in the Tsingtao campaign in September and October 1914 alongside four Maurice Farman MF.11s.\n\nOne of the first batch of aircraft purchased by the British Army's Air Battalion Royal Engineers (the precursor to the Royal Flying Corps) was a Nieuport IV.G and serialed B4. Additional IV.G monoplanes were purchased from private individuals including one from Claude Grahame-White and another from Charles Rumney Samson, plus three others. The Nieuport IVs were in service when the RFC carried out an investigation into monoplane crashes, and while the report covered an accident involving a Nieuport IV, it was the result of improper maintenance resulting in an engine failure, and not a structural failure such as with the Bristol monoplane and Deperdussin monoplane whose structural deficiencies led to the Monoplane Ban.\n\nArgentina purchased a single IV.G named la Argentina which served with the Escuela de Aviation Militaire.\n\nIn Greece a IV.G was bought privately and named Alkyon and after being the first aircraft to fly in Greece, was resold to the government which used it during the First Balkan War in 1912, flying from Larissa.\n\nSiam purchased 4 IV.Gs which were used as trainers at Don Muang airfield.\n\nSpain purchased one IV.G and 4 IV.Ms which were used by the Escuala Nieuport de Peu for training before 3 were transferred to an operational Escuela at Tetu\u00e1n which then moved to Zezulan, remaining operational until 1917.\n\nItaly's 1st Flottiglia Aeroplani of Tripoli operated several Nieuport IV.Gs during the Italo-Turkish War, one of which became the first aeroplane to be used in combat when it flew a reconnaissance mission against Turkish forces on 23 October 1911. It narrowly missed out to a Bleriot XI with the same unit for the honor of being the first aircraft to drop a bomb on enemy forces. The pilot who carried out the first mission Capt. Maizo, became one of the first victims of anti-aircraft fire, when he was shot down by an Austrian cannon weeks before the war ended in 1912.\n\nSurviving aircraft\n\nThe Swedish Air Force maintained their first model IV in airworthy condition until 1965. This aircraft is now preserved in the Flygvapenmuseum at Malmen near Link\u00f6ping. The Museo del Aire at Cuatro Vientos near Madrid has a full-scale replica of one of their model IVs.",

  "Eek-A-Mouse\n\nEek-A-Mouse (born Ripton Joseph Hylton, 19 November 1957) is a Jamaican reggae musician. He is one of the earliest artists to be described as a \"singjay\". Eek-A-Mouse is well known for pioneering his own style of scatting, differing from the-then toasting deejays in the 80s.\n\nBiography\n\nBorn in Kingston, Jamaica, Eek-A-Mouse began his music career when he was in college, releasing two roots reggae singles under his own name, which were produced by his mathematics tutor, Mr. Dehaney. These early works were influenced by the music of Pablo Moses. He then went on to work for various sound systems over the next few years and also released a few more singles. He adopted the stage name \"Eek-A-Mouse\" in 1979, taking the name of a racehorse he always bet on; it was a nickname his friends had used for some time. He began recording for Joe Gibbs in 1979, having a hit straight away with \"Once a Virgin\", now showing the influence of Ranking Joe, and this was soon followed with \"Wa-Do-Dem\" (produced by Douglas Boothe), and \"Modelling Queen\", which began an association with Linval Thompson, who produced his debut Bubble Up Yu Hip album.\n\nBy the end of 1980, he had linked up with producer Henry \"Junjo\" Lawes, with whom he had big hits in 1981 with the likes of \"Virgin Girl\" and a recut \"Wa-Do-Dem\". In 1981, he was the star of the Reggae Sunsplash Festival, cheering audiences still mourning over the death of reggae icon Bob Marley. His association with Lawes led to a string of successful singles and albums, and in 1982 his hits included \"Wild Like a Tiger\", \"For Hire and Removal\", \"Do You Remember\", and \"Ganja Smuggling\". The same year he released his second album, Wa Do Dem. The \"Operation Eradication\" single showed Hylton's serious side, the song inspired by the vigilante killing of close friend and fellow DJ Errol Shorter. Skidip was released before the year was out.\n\nFurther albums followed with 1983 Mouse and the Man, produced by Linval Thompson, and 1984 Mouseketeer, again produced by Lawes. He also featured on several of the live dancehall albums from the era, including the Aces International and Live at Skateland collections. In the second half of the decade his popularity began to wane slightly, and he targeted the United States with the Assassinator album in 1985 (his first US release), produced by Anthony and Ronald Welch. He also travelled to the United Kingdom to record The King and I the same year, the album targeted at the rock crossover audience to which he had begun to appeal.\n\nHis 1988 album Eek-A-Nomics saw him begin to establish himself with an international audience, spawning a club hit with \"The Freak\", and he was signed by Island Records in 1989. He returned to prominence with 1991's U-Neek album, which continued the rock-oriented style, including a cover version of Led Zeppelin's \"D'yer Mak'er\", and from which the hit single \"You're The One I Need\" was taken. He went through a period of relative quietness before returning in 1996 with the Black Cowboy album.\n\nHe also has a performance in the 1991 gangster movie New Jack City playing a drug-dealing Rastafarian named Fat Smitty. That same year, he also had a performance in Out for Justice playing a chauffeur of a pimp.\n\nEek-A-Mouse is a regular at Sunsplash and often teams up with reggae duo Michigan & Smiley. An album was issued of his performance in 1983.\n\nHe performed in Jamaica for the first time in eight years in August 2015 at the Marcus Garvey Festival in Ocho Rios.\n\nCollaborations\n\nHe was also featured on nu metal group P.O.D.'s album Satellite, lending his vocals to the rock-reggae track \"Ridiculous.\" He can also be heard on OPM's album, ForThemAsses, on the track \"Perfect Day.\" Eek-A-Mouse recorded a song with hip-hop recording artist Ditch, called \"Smoke it up\" (2007, released in 2009), which is featured on Ditch's CD Public Intoxication. The song by Ditch and Eek-a-Mouse is featured on the Jack Herer documentary as well. Has as well teamed up with Bounty Killer and Damian Marley in \"Khaki Suit\".\n\nLegal issues\n\nOn 16 August 2008, Eek-a-Mouse was arrested on charges of rape and narcotic possession. He fled the United States and an arrest warrant with a million dollar bond was issued. These charges were filed in Dare County, North Carolina after a performance at the Port O' Call restaurant. He failed to appear at the first hearing and was given a failure to appear charge and his bond was set at $1,375,000.\n\nOn 21 November 2012, Eek-a-Mouse was found in Paraguay without a proper visa and was extradited to the US. He was initially charged with felony rape, felony kidnapping, felony cocaine charges and misdemeanor relating to possession of marijuana. In July 2013 he was released after a plea agreement, having pleaded \"no contest\" to misdemeanor charges for assault on a female and attempted crime against nature, with his time already spent in jail covering his sentence.",
  "Ordo Secreta Sapientiae\n\nThe Ordo Secreta Sapientiae (Order of Secret Wisdom 1886 - 1898) was one of several initiatory Rosicrucian orders that developed during the Victorian magical revival, alongside such groups as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and the Aurum Solis. Its early membership consisted of former members of Kenneth MacKenzies's Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia (SRIA) and students of Frederick Hockley, who died in 1885 and passed on many of his papers It is quite probable that the initiatory structure of the Ordo Secreta Sapientiae was borrowed from the SRIA, which was in turn borrowed from the German \"Order of the Golden and Rosy Cross\". The focus of the Secreta Sapientiae was in excavating secret pagan symbolism buried within the art of Christian Europe, which they, and others, believed could be found in its painting and architecture. Never achieving the fame of its contemporaries, the Ordo Secreta Sapientiae was dissolved in 1898, and its members began drifting into the orbit of the Golden Dawn, just as that organization was beginning to fracture",

  "Ant-keeping\n\nAnt-keeping (or ant keeping) is a hobby involving the capture, care, and observation of ants and ant colonies. It is a form of lay myrmecology.\n\nHistory\n\nKeeping ants as pets has been a common hobby since the mass-marketed Uncle Milton's Ant Farm achieved commercial success in the late 1950s, though these ant farms did not include a queen ant for legal reasons. With exception of Pogonomyrmex occidentalis, U.S. Federal law prohibits shipping live queen ants of other species (and other \u201cplant pests\u201d) in interstate commerce.\n\nReasons for ant-keeping\n\nAnt keepers may choose to keep ants in captivity for the purpose of documenting ant behavior (in the case of an ant species which is difficult to observe in the wild). This field of study is called myrmecology. Ant keepers may also choose to keep ants as a casual hobby; i.e., as pets. People who keep ants may also keep them for scientific purposes and experiments.\n\nStarting a colony\n\nThere are differing methods of starting, caring for, and housing an ant colony. In the United States queen ants can be bought from vendors provided that the seller is from your state and that the species purchased is also native to your state. If you are in the UK or in any other European country, most exotic species of ant can be purchased legally through vendors though it depends on local laws.\n\nLocating a queen ant\n\nThe first step involved in ant keeping is capturing a fertilized queen ant. Ants engage in nuptial flights during spring, summer, and some species have also been recorded to have their nuptial flights during winter. After these flights a fertilized queen ant will land and remove her wings before locating a spot to found her new colony. Nuptial flights often happens after a heavy rain or a drastic seasonal change. If a queen has already chewed her wings off, she is likely (but not certainly) fertilized. If a queen ant on the ground still has her wings, she is likely unfertilized.\n\nA queen ant can be distinguished from an ergate (worker ant) by the relatively larger size of the thorax (which at this point contains the wing muscles of the queen), and the enlarged abdomen which contains eggs. Beware that certain species have large workers similar in size to a queen; Pheidologeton diversus, for example, possesses several castes of dinergates (soldier ants). If the possible queen you are looking at has marks on either side of the thorax (wing scars, where the wings of the queen were) it is a queen. If not, it's a supermajor; a larger worker of the colony.\n\nHousing the queen ant\n\nFor fully claustral species, the queen should be sealed in a dark, aerated small container with access to water. One way to provide this environment involves using a test tube, some water, and two cotton balls. One cotton ball is pressed against the water, the queen is inserted, and the other cotton ball is used to plug the end of the tube. This nesting chamber should be kept in the dark for one month while the queen lays her eggs and tends to them until they hatch. A claustral ant species need not be fed during this period, as a queen ant will digest her now-useless wing muscles to provide her with the necessary energy until her first generation of workers emerges. But feeding a small drop of honey energises the queen ant and reduces the chances of her eating her own eggs.\n\nFor a semi-claustral species, which will require food during this nesting phase, protein rich foods should be provided intermittently during the pre-worker phase, with the frequency and type of food determined by the specific species of ant.\n\nMoving the ants into a larger housing\n\nIf successful with feeding the first generation of workers, the queen ant should continue laying eggs. Eventually (at about 25 worker ants), the colony should be moved into a larger housing such as a formicarium to allow continued growth of the colony. If you wish to put your ants into a setup before this 'worker limit', you may purchase a 'test tube outworld' which will allow them to be fed more easily, while still inside the test tube.\n\nDietary needs\n\nAn ant's diet should consist primarily of sugars/carbohydrates (such as fruit, sugar water, raw honey, or honeydew) and proteins (such as mealworms, cockroaches, or bits of egg). The sugars are necessary to provide the ants with energy, and the proteins are necessary for the growth of the colony. Uneaten food should be removed to prevent the growth of mold in the formicarium.\n\nEnvironmental needs\n\nBesides the obvious need of a formicarium and outworld (A separate container, often decorated to resemble the outside world, in which the ants forage for food.), ants require certain conditions to thrive. For one, almost all ants, save for a few twig nesting species, will not survive without a source of humidity in their nest. This can be accomplished in many ways; some nests are made of a naturally absorbent material, such as plaster, some contain a sponge or cotton ball which is watered when need be, and others still contain a reservoir of water which evaporates over time. Most ants also appreciate a heat source; as ants are cold blooded, their colonies develop faster the warmer their nest is. A heating cable is the preferred method of many antkeepers, but heat lamps, heating pads, and un-air conditioned rooms are all worthy alternatives. Many antkeepers keep their ants in a dark area to avoid stressing them (Ants usually live underground and flee from light in their nest, which would indicate a breach.), though most species become desensitized to light after being exposed to it frequently. While light-aversion can be a useful tool when moving colonies to new habitats, the benefits of having ants both indifferent to observation and more easily monitored far outweighs this, especially when more effective alternatives, such as physical disturbance to or partial disassembly of the formicarium exist.\n\nLaws on keeping ants\n\nThe legality of intentionally shipping reproductive ants (usually a mated queen or whole colony) across state, provincial, or international borders varies substantially by country. In the United States, it is illegal to ship live queen ants across state lines without a license or explicit permission from relevant state or federal entities. As of 2019, however, at least one species (Pogonomyrmex occidentalis) is legal to ship within the United States, with the exception of Alaska, California, Florida, and Hawaii. In Europe, some domestic species (such as Formica rufa) are protected, and it is illegal to own, keep, buy, or sell these ants, or to damage their nests. However, unlike for reptiles and spiders, there are no rules for owning, keeping, buying or selling non-protected species inside the EU and many other countries.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nOver the years ant-keeping has become more normalised through the internet. Ants Canada and Ants Australia are both some of the key influencers in ant-keeping culture. They have together helped society think of ant keeping as a normal hobby and not one to be afraid of.",
  "Taylor's Bay\n\nTaylor's Bay a settlement located east of Lamaline in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. On a 1744 French map the cove was noted as Baye de Tailleur. William and Martha Bonnell, who had moved from Lamaline, are noted as the first settlers to the community.\n\nThe 1929 Grand Banks earthquake and tsunami struck this small fishing community destroying many small ships and local stores. Only five of the seventeen houses remained standing. The home of Leo Bonnell was swept across the road by the giant wave. He was later quoted \"If that's where God wanted it that's where it will stay.\u201d The house remains on that site to this day. A relief committee was established by the Newfoundland government soon after the disaster and provided lumber and other building supplies to reconstruct and build new houses.\n\nThe local post office was closed on September 13, 1966. The population was 74 in 1956. Its population had fallen to 13 by 1991 (out of a subdivisional remainder of 20), to 8 in 1996 (the entire 'between communities' population), and to 5 by 2001 (again, the entire remainder population of the subdivision (2G)). The population then rose, however, by the 2006 census to 10 (again, the remainder population), and this was the same figure (10) that was reported in 2011. The 2016 census returned, again, a population figure of 10, indicating a relatively stable population in a subdivision whose overall population is still slowly falling from its peak of several decades ago.",

Based in New York and Houston, the group consists of Shehryaar Asif, Hussain Asif, Atif Khan and Waqas Riaz. Since creating their first channel (DhoomBros) in 2008, their videos have gathered over 55 million views, excluding those from their more recent channel (The DhoomBros) started in 2012.\n\nThey are particularly known for their satirical takes on everyday Desi lives, parodies of mainstream entertainment, video blogs, short films, and their Mehndi dance performances. In 2016, the group began streaming their online drama Hum Kahan Chal Diye consisting of 12 episodes, and are currently involved in many other projects.\n\n2008\u201311: Early beginnings and background\n\nThe DhoomBros were formed in 2008 as a four-member group consisting of Hussain Asif, Shehryaar Asif, Atif Khan, and Waqas Riaz. The idea of calling themselves \"DhoomBros\" came within the name itself: \"Dhoom\" Bros (Dhoom = Blast in Urdu). The song \"Dhoom Again\", from the 2006 Bollywood film Dhoom 2, was a popular hit amongst South Asians but the Western world was generally unaware of it. Brothers Shehryaar and Hussain Asif performed to that song in a school talent show and received recognition from their peers and the school faculty. At this point, they called themselves the DhoomBros. This motivated them to entertain people through dance and various acts and so on June 23, 2008, the DhoomBros officially created their first YouTube channel (DhoomBros) and their official Facebook page. Atif Khan, the group's mutual friend, and Waqas Riaz, the cousin of the Asif brothers, joined later because they had similar interests. They started off making videos such as \"Jimmy And Saleem\" and \"The Desi Mobsta Show\". They also would upload videos of themselves talking about weird things that have happened to them throughout their week, either at home, at school, or in daily life.\n\nWhen they started out they had nicknames, Hussain was \"Desi Mobsta\" or \"Don\". Waqas was \"Daku\", Sheharyar was just \"Shehry\". Now, Hussain has a refurbished nickname \"Hussain Superstar\" or \"Sain\", Atif is \"Ati\" or \"Khan Saab\".Shehryaar is \"Shehry\" or \"Director Saab\" or even \"Teacher\" and Waqas is \"Wiqs\".\n\n2012\u201313\n\nIn 2012, DhoomBros videos became more frequent from Stuff Pakistanis Say, a video that comically represents common Pakistani household events and phrases, to Humsafar Best Scenes Parody, a parody based on the Pakistani drama serial, Humsafar, to the Annoying Brown Girls/Guys series, videos that show banter that stereotypical Desi teenagers seem to portray.\n\nIn October 2012, their popularity increased after the DhoomBros released their video \"Desi Style\", a parody based on South Korean pop artist Psy's hit single \"Gangnam Style\". The DhoomBros chant in English, Urdu and Punjabi about their everyday Desi American lives, consisting of waking up to their mother\u2019s voice, going to school, and greeting their grandfather, all accompanied with song and dance.\n\nThe group also experiment outside comical videos. Blessings of Ramadan is a video portraying three young men who indulge in materialistic aspects of their lives and fall astray from their spirituality by forgetting the significance of the month of Ramadan, the Muslim month of fasting and prayer. The Perfect Memory is the DhoomBros' first short film about the unexpected sacrifices one may have to make when it comes to love. Both videos were unlike the group's usual comical parodies, but were still well-garnered by audiences.\n\nShehryaar Asif and Waqas Riaz are known for uploading occasional video blogs that highlight various aspects of the lives of the DhoomBros, such as showing sneak peeks of their projects and being DJs at work. They also document their trips, such as to different cities in the United States of America and their stay in Pakistan. In addition to being YouTube entertainers, the DhoomBros are also DJs and often perform at weddings, mehndi events, and other parties. Apart from their comical videos, their mehndi performances have also gathered many views.\n\n2014\u2013present\n\nOne of the DhoomBros' most recent popular videos is the Evolution of Bollywood Dance, inspired by Penn Masala's Evolution of Bollywood Music. In this video, the DhoomBros recreate the dancing styles that the Bollywood film industry has witnessed over the years from the golden-aged actors From Raj Kapoor to Shammi Kapoor and Jeetendra to Dharmendra and Mithun Chakraborty and to the stars of today such as Hrithik Roshan, Salman Khan, and Shah Rukh Khan.\n\nAfter debuting in their first venture in the web-series iDeewane, the DhoomBros released their new drama Hum Kahan Chal Diye on 29 April 2016 featuring The DhoomBros and Divya Kalia as lead actress opposite Hussain Asif.",
  "Taiwanese cuisine\n\nTaiwanese cuisine (, Bopomofo:\u310a\u311e\u02ca\u3128\u3122\u02c9\u310c\u3127\u3120\u02cb\u310c\u3127\u02c7, or, Bopomofo:\u310a\u311e\u02ca\u3128\u3122\u02c9\u3118\u311e\u02cb) has several variations. The earliest known cuisines of Taiwan are that of the Taiwanese indigenous peoples. Over hundred years of historical development; mainstream Taiwanese cuisine has been influenced by Hakka cuisine, the cuisines of the waishengren, and Japanese cuisine. Although southern Fujian cuisine has had the most profound impact.\n\nHistory and development\n\nTaiwanese culinary history is murky and is intricately tied to patterns of migration and colonization. Local and international Taiwanese cuisine, including its history, is a politically contentious topic. Taiwan's complex and diverse identity makes Taiwanese cuisine hard to communicate.\n\nThe history of Taiwanese cuisine began with the cuisine of aboriginal peoples on the island of Taiwan, which existed in the ancient times without written records. From the Ming dynasty in 16th century, a large number of immigrants from the southern provinces of China, especially the Hoklo people, brought the rich Chinese culinary culture to Taiwan. At the same time, Hakka people from Fujian developed a separate cuisine culture from Hoklo people. Because of the influence of Chinese immigration, Taiwanese cuisine often leads to it being classified as 'Southern Chinese cuisine'. Due to the period of Japanese rule, Taiwanese cuisine was also strongly influenced by Japanese washoku and y\u014dshoku. After WWII, the Kuomintang retreat to Taiwan brought along many Chinese cuisines outside the province of Fujian or Southeast China. After that, the dishes from whole mainland China especially Guangdong, Chaoshan, Shanghai, Sichuan and Beijing could be easily found in Taiwan. In the decades since the KMT's retreat these regional dishes have evolved and become part of Taiwanese cuisine.\n\nAccording to Taiwanese chef Fu Pei-mei, authentic Chinese culinary traditions were properly preserved in Taiwan. This claim to authenticity, common among Fu's generation, was in part due to the Kuomintang's Chinese nationalist political messaging which extended well beyond cuisine.\n\nIngredients and culture\n\nPork, seafood, chicken, rice, and soy are common ingredients. Traditionally, rice formed the basis of most Taiwanese diets. Before the Japanese colonial period, most rice grown in Taiwan was long-grained indica rice. The Japanese introduced short-grained japonica rice which quickly changed both the farming and eating patterns of the Taiwanese. Due to Japanese influence, the Taiwanese generally prefer rice that is plump, aromatic, slightly firm, and sweet. Differences between the Taiwanese and Japanese rice preferences are demonstrated by differences in their cuisine with Taiwan's more flavorful and aggressive cooking methods calling for highly aromatic rice while the Japanese prefer a more subtle and pure taste and smell. During the Japanese Colonial period, Taiwanese cuisine was divided. High-end restaurants, or wine houses, served Chinese cuisine such as Peking duck, shark fin with bird's nest soup, and braised turtle to the colonial elite. In the meantime, those without wealth or connections primarily ate rice, porridge, pickled vegetables, and sweet potato leaves. Cooking oil was considered a luxury and was only used for special occasions.\n\nTaiwan's cuisine has also been influenced by its geographic location. Living on a crowded island, the Taiwanese had to look aside from the farmlands for sources of protein. As a result, seafood figures prominently in their cuisine. This seafood encompasses many different things, from large fish such as tuna and grouper, to sardines and even smaller fish such as anchovies. Crustaceans, squid, and cuttlefish are also eaten. Milkfish is the most popular fish in Taiwanese cuisine; it is valued for its versatility as well as its tender meat and economical price.\n\nBeef is less common than other proteins, and some Taiwanese (particularly the elderly generation) still refrain from eating it. This stems from traditional reluctance toward slaughtering precious cattle needed for agriculture, and an emotional attachment and feeling of gratitude and thanks to the animals traditionally used for very hard labor. However, due to influences from the influx of mainland Chinese in the 1900s, the Taiwanese version of beef noodle soup is now one of the most popular dishes in Taiwan. American food aid in the decades following WWII which primarily consisted of wheat, beef, and processed meats like Spam forever changed the Taiwanese diet with wheat-based noodles, breads, and dumplings taking a more central role in the cuisine. Rice consumption in Taiwan reached a height of 80-90 kilograms per person per year in the 1960s and 1970s before falling as consumers shifted consumption to wheat-based foods. However, the Taiwanese still consume a large quantity of rice, particularly brown rice and exotic varieties like black, purple, and red rice. Recently rice consumption in Taiwan has enjoyed a renaissance with both growers and consumers devoting the level of care and attention to the rice that is given to high-value crops like tea.\n\nBecause of the island's sub-tropical location, Taiwan has an abundant supply of various fruit, such as papayas, starfruit, melons, and citrus fruit. A wide variety of tropical fruits, imported and native, are also enjoyed in Taiwan. Other agricultural products in general are rice, corn, tea, pork, poultry, beef, fish and other fruits and vegetables. Fresh ingredients in Taiwan are readily available from markets.\n\nIn many of their dishes, the Taiwanese have shown their creativity in their selection of spices. Taiwanese cuisine relies on an abundant array of seasonings for flavor: soy sauce, rice wine, sesame oil, fermented black beans, pickled radish, pickled mustard greens, peanuts, chili peppers, cilantro (sometimes called Chinese parsley) and a local variety of basil.\n\nTaiwanese black vinegar has more in common with Worcestershire sauce than other black vinegars and is considered an outlier among black vinegars. Its base is sticky rice which is then aged with other ingredients in clay pots. It is used as a condiment and seasoning. Kong Yen is the largest producer of Taiwanese black vinegar. According to Bon Appetit, compared to Chinese black vinegars it is \"simpler, fruitier, and cleaner.\"\n\nAn important part of Taiwanese cuisine is xiaochi (\u5c0f\u5403), substantial snacks along the lines of Spanish tapas or Levantine meze.\n\nThe Taiwanese xiaochi has gained much reputation internationally. Many travelers go to Taiwan just for xi\u01ceoch\u012b. The most common place to enjoy xi\u01ceoch\u012b in Taiwan is in a night market. Each night market also has its own famous xi\u01ceoch\u012b.\n\nMoreover, the Taiwanese xi\u01ceoch\u012b has entered more \"refined\" eating environments. Nowadays, Taiwanese xi\u01ceoch\u012b can be found in luxury and high-end restaurants. These restaurants use higher quality ingredients and creative presentations, reinventing dishes whilst keeping the robust flavors. The prices usually jump by twice the price or even higher in the restaurants. The Taiwanese government supports the Taiwanese xi\u01ceoch\u012b and has held national xi\u01ceoch\u012b events in Taiwan regularly.\n\nModern Taiwanese cuisine is influenced by Taiwan's freedom and openness which enables chefs to innovate and experiment.\n\nRoadside banquet chefs are ubiquitous in Taiwan; these small (often single-person) catering firms provide on-location cooking for wedding banquets and other celebrations often held on the roadside. During the COVID-19 pandemic these chefs saw a significant downturn in business due to the lack of people hosting large traditional functions, especially those around the Lunar New Year.\n\nVegetarianism and veganism\n\nVegetarian restaurants are commonplace with a wide variety of dishes, mainly due to the influence of Buddhism and other syncretistic religions like I-Kuan Tao. These vegetarian restaurants vary in style from all-you-can-eat to pay-by-the-weight and the regular order-from-a-menu. Vegetarian restaurants and foods are often marked with a left-facing swastika.\n\nIn the 21st century Taiwan has seen a rise in non-religious vegetarians, especially among the young. There has also been a rise in veganism with concerns about animal welfare, personal health, environmental sustainability, and climate change driving both trends. Taiwan's traditional vegetarian products companies have also expanded into the booming fake meat market. The traditional culinary use of fake meat in Taiwan has given Taiwanese companies an edge and Taiwan is now a market leader in the fake meat sector. Taiwanese companies do a significant amount of export business, particularly in the European, North American, and Southeast Asian markets. Hung Yang Foods, one of the largest producers of fake meat products, does 80% of their business overseas with their products being stocked in 90% of Australian supermarkets.\n\nTypical dishes\n\nThere is a type of outdoor barbecue called. To barbecue in this manner, one first builds a hollow pyramid up with dirt clods. Next, charcoal or wood is burnt inside until the temperature inside the pyramid is very high (the dirt clods should be glowing red). The ingredients to be cooked, such as taro, yam, or chicken, are placed in cans, and the cans are placed inside the pyramid. Finally, the pyramid is toppled over the food until cooked.\n\nMany non-dessert dishes",
  "Bekker numbering\n\nBekker numbering or Bekker pagination is the standard form of citation to the works of Aristotle. It is based on the page numbers used in the Prussian Academy of Sciences edition of the complete works of Aristotle and takes its name from the editor of that edition, the classical philologist August Immanuel Bekker (1785\u20131871); because the Academy was located in Berlin, the system is occasionally referred to by the alternative name Berlin numbering or Berlin pagination.\n\nBekker numbers consist of up to three ordered coordinates, or pieces of information: a number, the letter a or b, and another number, which refer respectively to the page number of Bekker's edition of the Greek text of Aristotle's works, the page column (a standard page of Bekker's edition has exactly two columns), and the line number (total lines typically ranging from 20-40 on a given column or page in Bekker's edition). For example, the Bekker number denoting the beginning of Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics is 1094a1, which corresponds to page 1094 of Bekker's edition, first column (column a), line 1.\n\nAll modern editions or translations of Aristotle intended for scholarly readers use Bekker numbers, in addition to or instead of page numbers. Contemporary scholars writing on Aristotle use the Bekker number so that the author's citations can be checked by readers without having to use the same edition or translation that the author used.\n\nWhile Bekker numbers are the dominant method used to refer to the works of Aristotle, Catholic or Thomist scholars often use the medieval method of reference by book, chapter, and sentence, albeit generally in addition to Bekker numbers.\n\nStephanus pagination is the comparable system for referring to the works of Plato, and Diels-Kranz numbering is the comparable system for Pre-Socratic philosophy. Unlike Stephanus pagination, which is based upon a three-volume translation of Plato's works and which recycles low page numbers across the three volumes, introducing the possibility for ambiguity if the Platonic work or volume is not specified, Bekker page numbers cycle from 1 through the end of the Corpus Aristotelicum regardless of volume, without starting over for some other given volume. Bekker numbering therefore has the advantage that its notation is unambiguous as compact numerical information, although it relies upon the ordering of Aristotle's works as presented in Bekker's edition.\n\nAristotle's works by Bekker numbers\n\nThe following list is complete. The titles are given in accordance with the standard set by the Revised Oxford Translation. Latin titles, still often used by scholars, are also given.\n\nConstitution of the Athenians\n\nThe Constitution of the Athenians (or Athenai\u014dn Politeia) was not included in Bekker's edition because it was first edited in 1891 from papyrus rolls acquired in 1890 by the British Museum. The standard reference to it is by section (and subsection) numbers.\n\nFragments\n\nSurviving fragments of the many lost works of Aristotle were included in the fifth volume of Bekker's edition, edited by Valentin Rose. These are not cited by Bekker numbers, however, but according to fragment numbers. Rose's first edition of the fragments of Aristotle was Aristoteles Pseudepigraphus (1863). As the title suggests, Rose considered these all to be spurious. The numeration of the fragments in a revised edition by Rose, published in the Teubner series, Aristotelis qui ferebantur librorum fragmenta, Leipzig, 1886, is still commonly used (indicated by R3), although there is a more current edition with a different numeration by Olof Gigon (published in 1987 as a new vol. 3 in Walter de Gruyter's reprint of the Bekker edition), and a new de Gruyter edition by Eckart Sch\u00fctrumpf is in preparation.\n\nFor a selection of the fragments in English translation, see W.D. Ross, Select Fragments (Oxford 1952), and Jonathan Barnes (ed.), The Complete Works of Aristotle: The Revised Oxford Translation, vol. 2, Princeton 1984, pp. 2384\u20132465.\n\nThe works surviving only in fragments include the dialogues On Philosophy (or On the Good), Eudemus (or On the Soul), On Justice, and On Good Birth. The possibly spurious work, On Ideas survives in quotations by Alexander of Aphrodisias in his commentary on Aristotle's Metaphysics. For the dialogues, see also the editions of Richard Rudolf Walzer, Aristotelis Dialogorum fragmenta, in usum scholarum (Florence 1934), and Renato Laurenti, Aristotele: I frammenti dei dialoghi (2 vols.), Naples: Luigi Loffredo, 1987.\n\nUse in citations\n\nTo cite a work of the Corpus Aristotelicum or part thereof, Bekker numbers may be combined with book, chapter, and line numbers to give a precise reference. By academic convention, and regardless of the citation style otherwise generally followed throughout an academic work, the pagination in a citation to Aristotle would be in the general form of: Book number(s).Chapter number(s),Bekker number(s)Line number(s).\n\nFor example, a citation of (Metaphysics, 1.9,991b9-20) would refer to lines 9-20 on page 991b of chapter 9 in Book I of the Metaphysics.",
  "J\u00f3zef and Wiktoria Ulma\n\nServants of God J\u00f3zef and Wiktoria Ulma, a Polish husband and wife, living in Markowa near Rzesz\u00f3w in south-eastern Poland during the Nazi German occupation in World War II, were the Righteous who attempted to rescue Polish Jewish families by hiding them in their own home during the Holocaust. They and their children were summarily executed on 24 March 1944 for doing so. Notably, despite the murder of Ulmas meant to strike fear into the hearts of villagers, their neighbours continued to hide Jewish fugitives until the end of World War II in Europe. At least 21 Polish Jews survived in Markowa during the occupation of Poland by Nazi Germany.\n\nBiography\n\nAt the onset of World War II, J\u00f3zef Ulma (born in 1900) was a prominent citizen in the village of Markowa: a librarian, a photographer, active in social life and the local Catholic Youth Association. He was an educated fruit grower and a bee-keeper. His wife Wiktoria (born Wiktoria Niemczak in 1912), was a homemaker. The Ulmas had six children: Stanis\u0142awa, age 8, Barbara, age 7, W\u0142adys\u0142aw, age 6, Franciszek, age 4, Antoni, age 3 and Maria, age 2. Another child was due to be born just days after the family's summary execution on 24 March 1944.\n\nWiktoria Ulma\n\nWiktoria Ulma, n\u00e9e Niemczak (10 December 1912 \u2013 24 March 1944) was from Markowa village near \u0141a\u0144cut. She was nine months pregnant, at the time of her death.\n\nWiktoria was born in Markowa as the seventh child of Jan Niemczak and his wife Franciszka. At the age of six, Wiktoria lost her mother. She took courses at the folk high school in Ga\u0107. In 1935, she married J\u00f3zef Ulma, 12 years' her senior, with whom she had six children: Stanis\u0142awa, age 8 at the time of her death, Barbara, age 7, W\u0142adys\u0142aw, age 6, Franciszek, age 4, Antoni, age 3 and Maria, age 2 in 1944. Wiktoria was an educated housewife, taking care of the home and their children. Through hard work, persistence and determination, the Ulmas were able to purchase a bigger farm (5 hectares in size) in Wojs\u0142awice near Sokal (now Ukraine), and had already begun planning a relocation when the war began. At the moment of her death, Wiktoria was about to give a birth to their seventh child.\n\nHolocaust rescue\n\nIn the summer and autumn of 1942, the Nazi police deported several Jewish families of Markowa to their deaths as part of the German Final solution to the Jewish question. Only those who were hidden in Polish peasants' homes survived. Eight Jews found shelter with the Ulmas: six members of the Szall (Szali) family from \u0141a\u0144cut including father, mother and four sons, as well as the two daughters of Chaim Goldman, Golda (Gienia) and Layka (Lea) Didner. J\u00f3zef Ulma put all eight Jews in the attic. They learned to help him with supplementary jobs while in hiding, to ease the incurred expenses.\n\nArrest and execution\n\nThe Ulmas were denounced by W\u0142odzimierz Le\u015b, a member of the Blue Police, who had taken possession of the Szall (Szali) family's real estate in \u0141a\u0144cut in spring 1944 and wanted to get rid of its rightful owners. In the early morning hours of 24 March 1944 a patrol of German police from \u0141a\u0144cut under Lieutenant Eilert Dieken came to the Ulmas' house which was on the outskirts of the village. The Germans surrounded the house and caught all eight Jews belonging to the Szali and Goldman families. They shot them in the back of the head according to eyewitness Edward Nawojski and others, who were ordered to watch the executions. Then the German gendarmes killed the pregnant Wiktoria and her husband, so that the villagers would see what punishment awaited them for hiding Jews. The six children began to scream at the sight of their parents' bodies. After consulting with his superior, 23-year-old Jan Kokott, a Czech Volksdeutscher from Sudetenland serving with the German police, shot three or four of the Polish children while the other Polish children were murdered by the remaining gendarmes. Within several minutes 17 people were killed. It is likely that during the mass execution Wiktoria went into labour, because the witness to her exhumation testified that he saw a head of a newborn baby between her legs.\n\nThe names of the other Nazi executioners are also known from their frequent presence in the village (Eilert Dieken, Michael Dziewulski and Erich Wilde). The village Vogt (W\u00f3jt) Teofil Kielar was ordered to bury the victims with the help of other witnesses. He asked the German commander, whom he had known from prior inspections and food acquisitions, why the children too had been killed. Dieken answered in German, \"So that you would not have any problems with them.\" On 11 January 1945, in defiance of the Nazi prohibition, relatives of the Ulmas exhumed the bodies to bury them in the cemetery, and found out that Wiktoria's seventh child had almost been born in the grave pit of its parents.\n\nCommemoration\n\nOn 13 September 1995, J\u00f3zef and Wiktoria Ulma were posthumously bestowed the titles of Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem. On 24 March 2004 a stone memorial to honor memory of the Ulma family was erected in Markowa. Their medals of honor were presented to J\u00f3zef's surviving brother, W\u0142adys\u0142aw Ulma. Their certificate informs that they tried to save Jews at the risk of their lives, but fails to mention that they died for them, as noted in the book Godni synowie naszej Ojczyzny.\n\nOn the 60th anniversary of their execution, a stone memorial was erected in the village of Markowa to honor the memory of the Ulma family. The inscription on the monument reads: \"Saving the lives of others they laid down their own lives. Hiding eight elder brothers in faith, they were killed with them. May their sacrifice be a call for respect and love to every human being! They were the sons and daughters of this land; they will remain in our hearts.\" At the unveiling of the monument, the Archbishop of Przemy\u015bl, J\u00f3zef Michalik \u2013 the President of the Polish Bishops' Conference \u2013 celebrated a solemn Mass.\n\nThe local diocesan level of the Roman Catholic Church in Poland initiated the Ulmas' beatification process in 2003. The Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone spoke in Rome of the heroic Polish family on 24 January 2007 during the inauguration of the Italian edition of Martin Gilbert's book ''I giusti. Gli eroi sconosciuti dell'Olocausto'' (\"The Righteous. Unknown Heroes of the Holocaust\").\n\nSpecial commemorations were held in Markowa on 24 March 2007 \u2013 63 years after the Ulma, Szall and Goldman families were massacred. Mass was celebrated, followed by the Way of the Cross with the intention of the Ulma family's beatification. Among the guests was the President of the Council of Krak\u00f3w, who laid flowers at the monument to the dead. The students of the local high-school presented their own interpretation of the Ulmas' family decision to hide Jews in a short performance entitled Eight Beatitudes. There was also an evening of poetry dedicated to the memory of the murdered. Older neighbors and relatives who knew them spoke about the life of the Ulmas. One historian from the Institute of National Remembrance presented archival documents; and, the Catholic diocesan postulator explained the requirements of the beatification process. On 24 May 2011, the completed documentation of their martyrdom was passed on to Rome for completion of the beatification process.\n\nA new Polish \"National Day of the Ulma Family\" has first been suggested by the former Prime Minister Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski. Subsequently, the growing support for a more formal commemoration inspired the Sejmik of Podkarpackie Voivodeship to name 2014 the Year of the Ulma Family (Rok Rodziny Ulm\u00f3w). The new Ulma Family Museum of Poles Saving Jews in Markowa was scheduled to be completed in 2015.\n\nBeatification process\n\nOn 17 September 2003 the Pelplin Diocese's Bishop Jan Bernard Szlaga initiated beatification process of 122 Polish martyrs died during World War II, including J\u00f3zef and Wiktoria Ulma with their six children among the others. On 20 February 2017 Congregation for the Causes of Saints allowed to take over management of the process of Ulma family by Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Przemy\u015bl.\n\nThe fate of the Ulmas became a symbol of martyrdom of Poles killed by the Germans for helping Jews. On 17 March 2016 The Ulma Family Museum of Poles Saving Jews in World War II was opened in Markowa in presence of the President of Poland, Andrzej Duda.",

  "Holland Land Office\n\nThe Holland Land Office building is located on West Main Street (New York state routes 5, 33 and 63) in downtown Batavia, New York, United States. It is a stone building designed by surveyor Joseph Ellicott and erected in the 1810s.\n\nIt was the third and last office of the Holland Land Company, which owned almost all of what is today Western New York. Ellicott presided over the survey, sale and ultimate settlement of a vast tract of land. In 1960 it was declared a National Historic Landmark, the first one in Western New York and the only one in Genesee County. Today it is a museum, with exhibits about the history of the company and the region.\n\nBuilding\n\nThe building is located on the south side of West Main between Ellicott and Thomas Avenues on the north, two blocks west of the county courthouse and the commercial center of downtown Batavia. To the west is the Oak Street (New York State Route 98) intersection.\n\nTonawanda Creek is to the south. The office occupies a narrow strip of land between it and the street. On its east the creek comes closer to West Main, leaving only enough room for a sidewalk; a parking lot is located on the west between the building and Oak Street. Across West Main is another parking lot, houses and a Dunkin' Donuts. The area is level, part of the creek's former flood plain.\n\nThe land office building itself is a one-and-a-half\u2013story limestone structure with a 47 by main block topped with an asphalt-shingled gabled roof. A wooden pedimented entrance portico projects from the north (front) elevation, and two additions are located to the southwest. One is a small one-story cinder block connector to the other, a large L-shaped timber frame wing with about 12 ft between it and the main block.\n\nFour round stone columns support the pediment, where a denticulated cornice frames an entablature faced in clapboard. Below the cornice are black letters spelling out \"Holland Land Office Museum\" on the plain frieze. The two six-over-six double-hung sash windows on either side of the main entrance have louvered shutters with stone sills and splayed lintels. Recessed panels top each window on the upper story.\n\nOn either side of the pediment small gabled dormer windows with eight-over-eight double-hung sash pierce the roof. Side fenestration consists of two windows similar to the front windows at ground level, two small windows on the second floor and a fanlight at the gable apex. The roofline has an overhanging eave with a continuation of the denticulation on the pediment.\n\nSmooth round pilasters frame the recessed main entrance, topped by a rounded fanlight. It opens into a central hall. There is one room on the east and two on the west. Both are used as exhibit space. There are eight wall vaults, originally used to store records. One has its original 10 ft metal door. Steel I-beams have been added to support the roof, and braces are visible in the west parlor. The upper stories are used for office and exhibit space, as are the additions.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Holland Land Company was formed late in the 18th century by a group of Dutch investors to dispose of lands they had acquired west of the Genesee River, originally owned by the state of Massachusetts and the Seneca Nation of the Iroquois Confederacy until the 1797 Treaty of Big Tree. The company had acquired them from Robert Morris, who had financed the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War, and needed to sell due to financial troubles in some of his other land dealings. In 1794 they hired Pennsylvania surveyor Joseph Ellicott to survey the five million acres (2 million ha) they had acquired in what is now Western New York and the adjacent areas of Northwestern Pennsylvania. After the survey was finished and the land subdivided into townships, Ellicott was appointed agent in 1800.\n\nWorking from the present site, Ellicott not only oversaw the sale of individual properties but functioned as the area's sole regional planner, reporting to Paolo Busti, the company's agent in Philadelphia, by mail. He was, a contemporary historian wrote, \"the single most powerful person in the area for the first two decades of the century.\" His decision to sell the land in small parcels rather than large blocks, despite the objections of the company's trustees who wanted the land sold quickly, resulted in settlement by small farmers rather than the establishment of quasi-feudal manors as had occurred in the Hudson Valley. Drawing on his experience laying out the city of Washington, D.C., for Pierre L'Enfant, he surveyed and planned the cities of Buffalo and Batavia.\n\nThe company's first office was a log cabin; Ellicott cleared the first tree on the site. In 1809 it was replaced with a timber-frame building, in turn replaced by the existing structure in 1815, the third and last one. It was built of stone to be fireproof and better protect the records it kept. At that time it stood alone on a two-acre (2 acre) lot. Ellicott left his position in 1820; the company remained in existence until the mid-1850s, by which time all the land had been sold and all the debts retired.\n\nThe building was eventually sold. It became first a music school, and then a church. To support those uses modifications were made to the interior.\n\nIn 1894 the Holland Purchase Historical Society was formed to restore the building and adapt it for museum use. Later that year the building was dedicated to Morris's memory at a ceremony attended by Morris's descendants and members of the Cabinet of President Grover Cleveland, who had himself begun his political career in Buffalo. It was staffed by members of the local Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) chapter.\n\nDuring World War II the DAR leased the building to the local chapter of the American Red Cross. At that time the cinder block addition was built on the rear. After the war, in 1948, the county's Board of Supervisors voted to assume ownership.\n\nThe western frame wing, known as the Robert Morris Wing, was added around 1970. To build it and the parking lot, a house next door was demolished. Seven years later it received an east wing, originally used by the county historian. Since that office moved to separate quarters nearby it has been used for the museum. The final addition came in 1982, a small room attached to the back of the wing's rear to exhibit the county's 12\u00bd-foot (12.5 ft) gibbet.\n\nMuseum\n\nThe museum's collection includes many artifacts of Ellicott's original survey of the region. These include not only his chains and transit, but the written records of the survey. An original copy of Ellicott's 1804 map, valued in the five figures, hangs on one wall.\n\nIroquois artifacts on display include a ca. 1700 succotash bowl, wampum beads and a model of a longhouse, the tribe's traditional habitation. There is also an armchair used by Seneca elder Eli Parker, and a charcoal sketch of Seneca Wolf Clan chief Red Jacket, wearing the silver medal George Washington gave him. They are exhibited in a room named for Parker.",

  "Nubia (character)\n\nNubia is a fictional character appearing in DC Comics publications and related media, commonly as an ally of Wonder Woman. Historically, she is DC Comics' first Black woman superhero. Introduced in 1973 as Wonder Woman's long-lost fraternal twin, Nubia has since been presented variously as DC Comics' continuities have shifted and evolved. At turns, she has been portrayed as both a parallel-universe version of Wonder Woman, and as an inheritor of the Wonder Woman mantle in a future timeline. Her Modern Era depiction is as a non-sibling Amazon contemporary of Wonder Woman, and as the successor to Wonder Woman's mother Hippolyta as queen of the Amazon nation of Themyscira. Created by Robert Kanigher and Don Heck, Nubia debuted in 1973's Wonder Woman (vol. 1) #204 and appeared intermittently throughout Wonder Woman's Bronze Age adventures. After DC Comics rebooted its continuity in 1985 (a publication event known as the Crisis on Infinite Earths), Wonder Woman and her supporting characters were re-imagined. Though originally absent from this revised mythos, the character was reintroduced as \"Nu'Bia\" in 1999 by Doselle Young and Brian Denham in Wonder Woman (vol. 2) Annual #8.\n\nIn DC's post-Rebirth era, the character (whose name has reverted to its original spelling) developed a significantly expanded profile and presence in Wonder Woman lore, beginning with the assumption of the Wonder Woman mantle for DC's 2021 future-timeline publication event Future State. She has been heavily featured across DC's Infinite Frontier Wonder Woman publications, including the limited series Nubia & the Amazons (2021), Trial of the Amazons (2022) and Nubia: Queen of the Amazons (2022). The publisher also commissioned young adult graphic novels featuring Nubia as the central character, including Nubia: Real One (2021) and Diana & Nubia: Princesses of the Amazons (2022).\n\nThe distinction of DC's first Black woman superhero character is also sometimes accorded to the Teen Titan Bumblebee, who debuted in 1976, four years after Nubia's first appearance.\n\nOrigin\n\nNubia was created by Robert Kanigher and Don Heck in 1973. While Kanigher had previously written Wonder Woman for nine years, he had left to work on other projects. He and then-partner Heck created Nubia in his first issue back on Wonder Woman (#204 in January 1973), part of a one-year stint for the team.\n\nNubia\n\nIn Wonder Woman #204 (January 1973), Diana (Wonder Woman) has her memories restored by the Amazons and is soon confronted by an armored female warrior who challenges her to single combat. The two initially wrestle, then face each other with swords. Diana and the intruder seem evenly matched until the intruder knocks the sword from Diana's hands, but then hesitates to kill her. The dark-skinned stranger introduces herself as Nubia, the one true Wonder Woman, and tells Diana that they will meet again someday to decide which of them has the right to the title. Diana's mother, Queen Hippolyta, secretly believes she recognizes Nubia, who returns to her own Floating Island. A short Nubia story in Wonder Woman #205 picks up with her departure from Paradise Island, including a short conversation and an embrace from Hippolyta. Back on her mist-concealed Floating Island, Nubia rules a community of all men. Upon her return, two men claim the right to fight for her, citing the \"law of the Floating Island\" or \"Mars' law of conquest\". Declaring \"No man will ever own Nubia!\" she fights one of the men herself, defeating him but letting him live. She says, \"A woman doesn't destroy life, she cherishes it!\".\n\nIn Wonder Woman #206, Hippolyta flashes back to the truth, a revised version of Wonder Woman's origin story: Hippolyta had formed two babies from clay, one dark and one light. They are brought to life by the gods, but Mars the god of war abducts baby Nubia, whom Hippolyta never sees again. Nubia is raised by Mars as his weapon of destruction against the Amazons. Mars and Nubia launch an attack on Paradise Island from their so-called \"Slaughter Island\". Coming to assist, Diana recognizes Mars' ring and removes it from Nubia's hand, breaking the god's mind control over Nubia. She and Diana oppose Mars, who flees, and Nubia leaves to lead her warriors \"into ways of peace\". Hippolyta reveals Nubia's origin to Diana.\n\nNubia's next appearance comes in Supergirl #9 (December 1973) written by Robert Kanigher. In the story Supergirl is made an honorary Amazon. Later when it is discovered that Nubia is suffering from a mutated shark poisoning, Hippolyta sends Kara to retrieve a rare root needed to cure her.\n\nIn Super Friends #25 (October 1979), Wonder Woman, who is temporarily under the control of the evil Overlord, is seen attempting to liberate the oppressed women of the African continent. She tells them that men still treat women as if they were possessions and it is time for women to stand up to men, with Wonder Woman as leader. Diana is interrupted by Nubia. She tells her to back off and they fight; eventually the Overlord is defeated and they part as friends.\n\nLong-term publication absence\n\nIt would be 20 years between Nubia's last pre-Crisis appearance in Super Friends #25 (October 1979) and first post-Crisis appearance in Wonder Woman (vol. 2) Annual #8 (September 1999). In the interim, new Black characters in Wonder Woman were introduced, such as Philippus, created by George Perez for the 1987 reboot of the Wonder Woman comic book.\n\nNu'Bia\n\nSometime after Crisis on Infinite Earths, a new version of Nubia, now called Nu'Bia, was introduced. When Nu'Bia first meets Diana, she mistakenly calls Diana by the name of her former queen \"Antiope\". Nu'Bia is only slightly surprised to discover that Diana is Antiope's niece. The woman identifies herself to Diana as Nu'Bia and says that she was a Themyscirian Amazon who won the \"Tournament of Grace and Wonder\" just as Diana previously had, and become the Amazons' first champion. Her assigned mission was to guard \"Doom's Doorway\", which is an entrance to the river Styx and the Tartarus Gate on Themyscira. Entering Doom's Doorway she was to guard the entryway from the inside, stopping anyone from entering or any creature from escaping. As Diana was never told of Nu'Bia, it is assumed that the Themyscirian Amazons assumed she perished during her mission long before Diana's birth. Sometime during her time in Hell, Nu'bia explains she met the Zoroastrian god of light, Ahura Mazda, and became his lover.\n\nThe next time Nu'Bia is shown, an elevator in a Las Vegas hotel suddenly manifests a golden metal lion insignia. When Diana investigates this strange occurrence, Nu'Bia steps out of the elevator. She says: \"Many leagues from the kingdom of light have I traveled. Through the province of Nox and the territory of shades have I hunted the demon-king Ahriman. Finally, to track him here, to Patriarch's World...to my ancient faraway home. How passing strange it is then, Princess, that I should find you here, as well\".\n\nThe demon Ahriman murdered Ahura Mazda, and carved his heart from his body. Nu'Bia had come back to earth in search of Ahriman, hoping that she can retrieve the heart and revive her lover. Nu'Bia had Ahriman in her possession and rides an elevator back to Hades to revive her beloved.\n\nNubia\n\nAfter DC Rebirth and Infinite Frontier, Nubia was featured in a back up story in the series Future State: Immortal Wonder Woman. This depicts Nubia in Man's World. After Future State and a new version of the Multiverse was created, this version of Nubia was reintroduced as an Amazonian champion tasked with guarding Doom's Doorway, a hellish portal on Themyscira. Nubia shortly became Queen of Amazons when Hippolyta returns to Man's World to represent Diana in the newest iteration of the Justice League. When Diana returned to the living, Diana officially blessed Nubia to share her title as Wonder Woman, in addition to her new role as Queen. While Nubia is no longer Diana's twin in a literal way, the two were both born on the same day and fostered a close sister-like relationship. Nubia is also shown as having a romantic relationship with the Amazon blacksmith Io.\n\nEarth-23\n\nRenee Montoya ventures forth with Earth-5's Captain Marvel in an attempt to recruit each universe's equivalent of Superman to join Nix Uotan's Army of Heaven on Earth-Zero (the primary DC Earth). The beginning of the last Final Crisis issue illustrates their visit to a universe where a Black Superman is the President of the United States.

  "Starship Troopers 3: Marauder\n\nStarship Troopers 3: Marauder is a 2008 American military science fiction horror film written and directed by Edward Neumeier and starring Casper Van Dien, who returned as Johnny Rico from the original film, along with Jolene Blalock and Boris Kodjoe. It is a sequel to Starship Troopers (1997) and Starship Troopers 2: Hero of the Federation (2004) (which were both written by Neumeier) and the third installment of the Starship Troopers film series. The film was released directly to video in the U.S. on August 5, 2008.\n\nPlot\n\nIn the eleven years of \"The Second Bug War\", the Mobile Infantry has improved their weapons and tactics, while the Bugs have countered by developing many new Arachnid variants. The United Citizen Federation now finds itself engaged in prolonged trench warfare. The Federation puts out a positive spin through the media, while using its judicial and military authority to suppress peace protesters and religious fanatics.\n\nColonel Johnny Rico is stationed on the agricultural planet Roku San, where the popular Sky Marshal Omar Anoke pays a visit. Rico's old friend, General Dix Hauser, gets into a bar fight with farmers protesting against the war. When Rico stops Dix from shooting a farmer, Dix orders his arrest, but the base defenses suddenly fail due to a Bug attack. Rico knocks down Dix and leaves to fight the Arachnids. When Roku San falls, Rico is blamed by the Federal Media and condemned to execution for insubordination.\n\nCaptain Lola Beck is piloting Anoke to Sanctuary, the Fleet's secret HQ, when they are marooned on classified planet OM-1. Admiral Enolo Phid suppresses this information, but Dix learns of the situation and has Rico's execution faked, wanting him to lead a rescue mission.\n\nOn OM-1, an apparent earthquake causes Dr. Wiggs to fall into a crevasse, where Anoke sees a giant eye staring from below. Cynical cook Jingo Ryan is next to die after he takes shelter within a cluster of rock outcroppings, which are actually Arachnid limbs which pull him below. Engineer Bull Brittles asks the deeply religious Holly Little to marry him, but dies shortly after.\n\nOn Earth, General Hauser confronts Admiral Phid about why she is abandoning the Sky Marshal, only to be arrested. Phid reveals to him that Anoke is responsible for the downfall of Roku San, having used psychic powers to communicate with the \"Brain of Brains\", also known as \"Behemecoatyl\", through a previously captured Brain Bug. The Sky Marshal, deluded into thinking that he could save humanity if he could make peace with them, adopted the Bugs\u2019 religion. He turned off the electric barrier surrounding the base on Roku San to demonstrate his willingness for peace. The Federation now believes the original Brain Bug allowed itself to be captured in order to pass on intelligence from inside the Federation. When the Federation decides to kill and dissect their Brain Bug, it somehow discerns their plot. It retaliates by unleashing a telepathic attack, and slaughters many soldiers before Hauser kills it.\n\nIt is revealed that Admiral Phid ignored the distress calls from OM-1 so she could become the new Sky Marshal; however, she failed to take into account that highly skilled Beck would be with Anoke.\n\nOn OM-1, the stranded make contact with Behemecoatyl, who communicates with them through the corpses of their fallen comrades and soon kills Anoke to absorb his knowledge; Beck and Holly, the last survivors, begin praying to be saved.\n\nRico leads the Marauders, an elite team of troopers, on a rescue mission, using the Federation's new battle-suits. They defeat the Arachnid warriors on OM-1, suffer no casualties, and rescue Beck and Holly. OM-1 is revealed to be the home of the Bug Hive, the Arachnids' ruling body, and Fleet destroys it from orbit with a \"Q Bomb\".\n\nRico is cleared of all pending charges, promoted to the rank of General and given command of the Marauder program. Anoke is reported to have died in a terrorist attack, staged by the government to explain his disappearance. Dix and Beck are married, Admiral Phid is appointed the new Sky Marshal with Dix as her second-in command, and Holly becomes the first Federal chaplain. Dozens of peace protesters are hanged in connection to the purported terrorist attack. Phid, impressed with the way that Sky Marshal Anoke was rendered servile by the Arachnids' religion, decides the Federation should adopt a religion, and Christianity is embraced by the Federation but altered to suit the Federation's needs to ensure steady recruitment, absolute loyalty and obedience who would follow without question.\n\nProduction\n\nEd Neumeier, wrote the screenplay of the previous two Starship Troopers films, and makes his directorial debut with this film. Neumeier says that he sees the Troopers as each reflecting different wars, and where the first film is inspired by the Second World War movies, this film is more of a Vietnam War film. The story also deals issues of religion and politics, and is about \"how the state can use religion both badly, and for good.\"\n\nCasper Van Dien returned for the third film and had been willing to return for the second film, but said Phil Tippett wanted to go a different direction.\n\nProduction started in May 2007, with principal photography commencing in South Africa.\n\nRobert Skotak served as Visual Effects Supervisor, and Roger Nall was the Digital Effects Supervisor responsible for the CGI creature design and the marauder battle armor sequences. Nall lead a team of about 25 people. Their team worked on over 350 effects shots for the bugs, and the Marauder sequence required about 100 shots more. Other companies worked on sequences such as space ships, puppet work, wire removal and more, an estimated 150 additional effects shots.\n\nCritical response\n\nStarship Troopers 3: Marauder received mixed reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 50% based on 6 reviews, 3 positive and 3 negative.\n\nLeydon of Variety said: \"Die-hard fans of Starship Troopers, Paul Verhoeven's notorious 1997 cult-fave sci-fi spectacle, will be pleased to note that its second made-for-vid sequel gamely attempts to replicate the original pic's over-the-top style and self-satirical tone. Unlike 2004's negligible Starship Troopers 2: Hero of the Federation, a relatively straightforward actioner, the latest episode reprises Verhoeven's love-it-or-hate-it mix of gruesome mayhem, overstated melodrama, peek-a-boo nudity and tongue-in-cheek fascist aesthetics.\" Alex Dorn of UGO.com stated that \"fans of the original movie should be pretty happy with this venture\" but that those \"expecting the whiz-bang big budget wonder of the original will be disappointed.\" He gave the film an overall rating of a B minus. Scott Weinberg of FEARnet gave the film a positive review, stating that the film is \"probably a rental more so than a must-own, but certainly worth a look if you dug the first film\". Ain't It Cool News gave the film a mixed review, saying the effects were a step down from the work of Phil Tippett in the second film, but welcomed the return to the satirical tone of the first film. The reviewer found the satire uneven, too specific at times, but also at other times unclear. He notes the problems and limitations of direct-to-video productions but concludes \"if you can get past that and you enjoy this world then there is goofy fun to be had.\"\n\nLowe at IGN gave the film 3 out of 10 and although he was impressed by the production values, he was not impressed by the film: \"The bottom line is that Starship Troopers 3 is a film that even Starship Troopers fans will have trouble enjoying. Even the return of Casper Van Dien and added studio interest and budget could not salvage this film from the perils of its own shortcomings.\" David Nusair of ReelFilm found it less effective than the second film and called it \"a misfire of near epic proportions\".\n\nAccolades\n\nIn March 2009, Starship Troopers 3: Marauder was nominated for a 2009 Saturn Award in the Best DVD Release Category.\n\nHome media\n\nThe film was released both Blu-ray and DVD on August 5, 2008. It is also part of Starship Troopers Trilogy DVD set, which contains the first three films in the series. Stephen Hogan's rendition of the theme song \"A Good Day to Die\" as Sky Marshall Omar Anoke is a bonus feature in the Blu-ray release. Film critic Joe Leydon wrote for Variety, \"Omar Anoke, the heroic sky marshal in charge of battling the big bugs, is a charismatic celebrity and chart-topping singer whose onstage movements and militaristic song list suggest Adolf Hitler as an 'American Idol' contestant.\" Scott Lowe of IGN wrote, \"the Sky Marshal's saber rattling pop single... calls to mind Lee Greenwood's 'I'm Proud to Be an American,'\" despite also commenting it's \"the most ridiculous and time wasting feature.\"\n\nHome media sales totaled $",

The show follows David's life, with numerous subplots including his family, friends, and coworkers, and primarily revolves around the club. The show explores themes such as adolescence, relationships, socioeconomic mobility, and the pursuit of happiness in a mostly comedic fashion against the backdrop of the New York\u2013New Jersey area in the 1980s.\n\nMain\n\n\u2022 Craig Roberts as David Myers, a college student majoring in accounting who gets a summer job as a tennis instructor for the club\n\n\u2022 Jennifer Grey as Judy Myers, David's mother\n\n\u2022 Richard Kind as Sam Myers, David's father\n\n\u2022 Ennis Esmer as Nash Nasser, David's supervisor, the tennis pro for the country club\n\n\u2022 Oliver Cooper as Wheeler, David's buddy and a valet at the country club\n\n\u2022 Alexandra Turshen as Misty, a lifeguard at the club\n\n\u2022 Gage Golightly as Karen, David's girlfriend and a yoga instructor for the club\n\n\u2022 Josh Meyers as Barry, the clubs videographer\n\n\u2022 Paul Reiser as Doug Getty, president of the country club and also David, Nash, and Wheeler's boss\n\n\u2022 Alexandra Socha as Skye Getty, Doug's daughter and an aspiring artist who takes a liking to David\n\nRecurring\n\n\u2022 Maria Dizzia as Professor Beryl Fox\n\n\u2022 Gina Gershon as Fay Getty, Doug's wife\n\n\u2022 Nate Smith as Skip\n\n\u2022 Greer Barnes as Terry\n\n\u2022 Rachel Feinstein as Jean Blum\n\n\u2022 David Fierro as Ganz\n\n\u2022 Brad Gilbert as Stan Feinberg\n\n\u2022 Jessica Hecht as Rebecca\n\n\u2022 John Hodgman as Travis\n\n\u2022 Mark Linn-Baker as Rabbi Ken\n\n\u2022 Tijuana Ricks as Shirley\n\n\u2022 Freddie Roman as Herb\n\n\u2022 Beth Stelling as Margot\n\n\u2022 James Waterston as Dr. Dale Blum\n\nProduction\n\nFor his role as Nash, Ennis Esmer read with director David Gordon Green in both his regular voice and what The New York Times describes as \"an invented accent he calls 'Indo Middle Eastern British'\", while trying to get Green to laugh.

But it's sometimes hard to tell if Red Oaks is a clever dissection of old, reactionary sex comedies, or if it's just a reactionary sex comedy itself. B+\"\n\nThe New York Times enjoyed the pilot:\n\n\"Set at a suburban New Jersey country club in 1985, Mr. Green's pilot is not a sendup of 1980s coming-of-age comedies or even a tribute to them, but a surprisingly straightforward extension of the genre. It's as if the spirits of John Hughes, Harold Ramis and the young Richard Linklater had all gotten together to consult.\"\n\nNewsday liked it as well:\n\n\"A funky retro-'80s distinctiveness makes 'Red Oaks' Amazon's single best new series. Dryly amusing, the characters are sharply drawn and often appealing \u2013 even when they are not. Ennis Esmer ruthlessly heists every scene he's in, and Craig Roberts deftly creates a character you may even recognize from your own past \u2013 only funnier.\"",

The town declined in the 1930s and became almost a ghost town in the late 1940s when the mine closed for the last time.\n\nThe Commonwealth Mine became one of Arizona's major silver producers. Over 1,000,000 tons of ore were produced from 1895 to 1942. There are about 20 miles of underground workings. The mine produced about $8 million worth of silver and $2.5 million in gold at a time when silver was priced around 50 cents an ounce, and gold was $20 an ounce.\n\nSunsites was established in the 1950s and 1960s by New York lawyer Joseph Timan and his Horizon Land Company.\n\nHistoric sites\n\nPearce is the home of two properties on the National Register of Historic Places.

  "Douglas v. California\n\nDouglas v. California, 372 U.S. 353 (1963), was a case before the United States Supreme Court.\n\nBackground\n\nTwo defendants were tried and convicted in a California state court on felony charges including robbery, assault with a deadly weapon, and assault with intent to commit murder.\n\nA single public defender had been appointed to represent them on these three charges. The attorney's motion for continuance at the beginning of trial was denied, although he stated that he was not as prepared as he should have been. Thereafter the defendants dismissed the defender and renewed motions for separate counsel and for a continuance. These motions were also denied. The defendants were convicted and subsequently filed appeals.\n\nExercising their only right to appeal as of right, they appealed to an intermediate Court of Appeals (District court of appeal of California, second appellate district), and, being indigent, applied to it for appointment of counsel to assist them on appeal. In accordance with a state rule of criminal procedure, that Court made an ex parte examination of the record, determined that appointment of counsel for petitioners would not be \"of advantage to the defendant or helpful to the appellate court\" and denied appointment of counsel. Their appeal was heard without assistance of counsel and their convictions were affirmed. The District Court of Appeal affirmed their convictions after denying their request for appointment of counsel under a California rule of criminal procedure authorizing such denial where after an independent investigation of the record the appellate court determines that appointment of counsel would be helpful to neither the defendant nor the court. (187 Cal App 2d 802, 10 Cal Rptr 188.)\n\nThe California Supreme Court denied their petitions for a discretionary review/hearing. (187 Cal App 2d 813, 10 Cal Rptr 214.)\n\nOpinion of the court\n\nThe Supreme Court of the United States vacated the judgment of the California District Court of Appeal. In an opinion by Justice Douglas, expressing the view of six members of the Court, it was held that the denial of counsel under the California rule of procedure stated above violated the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nHeld: Where the merits of the one and only appeal an indigent has as of right are decided without benefit of counsel, an unconstitutional line is drawn between rich and poor. The Court held that a procedure like the one used by the state appellate court in which an indigent defendant was denied counsel on appeal unless he first made a preliminary showing of merit did not comport with fair procedure. In vacating, the judgment of the state appellate court, the Court stated that where the merits of the one and only appeal an indigent had as of right were decided without benefit of counsel, an unconstitutional line had been drawn between rich and poor.\n\nThe Court vacated the judgment of the state appellate court and remanded for further proceedings consistent with the Court's opinion.\n\nDissent\n\nClark dissented on the ground that neither the equal protection clause nor the due process clause requires more than what is provided in the California rule.\n\nJustice Harlan, joined by Justice Stewart, dissented on the grounds that the equal protection clause was not apposite, and that the due process clause was not violated. His dissenting opinion also held that the defendants were not denied effective assistance of counsel in the trial court.",

  "Alexander Karl, Duke of Anhalt-Bernburg\n\nAlexander Charles, Duke of Anhalt-Bernburg (2 March 1805 &ndash; 19 August 1863) was a German prince of the House of Ascania. From 1834 until 1863 he was the last duke of the Duchy of Anhalt-Bernburg.\n\nEarly life\n\nAlexander Charles was born at Ballenstedt on 2 March 1805 as the second (but eldest and only surviving) son of Alexius Frederick Christian, Duke of Anhalt-Bernburg, by his first wife Maria Fredericka, daughter of William I, Elector of Hesse.\n\nSuccession\n\nAfter the death of his father in 1834, Alexander Karl succeeded him in Anhalt-Bernburg.\n\nMarriage\n\nIn Gottorp on 30 October 1834 Alexander Karl married Princess Friederike of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl\u00fccksburg, daughter of Frederick William, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl\u00fccksburg and his wife Princess Louise Caroline of Hesse-Kassel; she was also a sister of the later King Christian IX of Denmark. The union was childless.\n\nReign\n\nBy November 1855 the Duke was confined to Schloss Hoym due to a progressive mental illness (some sources state that he had schizophrenia).

  "Ryde\n\nRyde is an English seaside town and civil parish on the north-east coast of the Isle of Wight. The built-up area had a population of 23,999 according to the 2011 Census and an estimate of 24,847 in 2019. Its growth as a seaside resort came after the villages of Upper Ryde and Lower Ryde were merged in the 19th century, as can still be seen in the town's central and seafront architecture. The resort's expansive sands are revealed at low tide. Their width means the regular ferry service to the mainland requires a long listed pier \u2013 the fourth longest in the United Kingdom, and the oldest surviving.\n\nHistory\n\nIn 1782 numerous bodies of men, women and children from HMS Royal George, which sank suddenly at Spithead, were washed ashore at Ryde. Many were buried on land that is now occupied by the Esplanade. A memorial to them was erected in June 2004.\n\nThere are a series of Regency and Victorian buildings in the town with important buildings such as All Saints' Church, designed by the eminent George Gilbert Scott, and Ryde Town Hall, which was completed in 1831. Up until the pier was opened in 1814, ferry passengers landing at low tide were brought almost half a mile into the shore by horse and cart.\n\nGovernance\n\nRyde Town Council represents the residents of Ryde. Ryde Town Council is a statutory consultee in planning matters regarding Ryde. Their views are taken into account by the local planning authority, Isle of Wight Council.\n\nRyde residents are represented by Ward Councillors on the Isle of Wight Council.\n\nTransport\n\nThere is a hovercraft service to Southsea, which takes nine minutes. It is operated by Hovertravel near the Esplanade close to Ryde Esplanade railway station and the bus station. A catamaran service run by Wightlink operates from Ryde Pier to Portsmouth Harbour, which connects with both Island Line trains and mainland trains to London Waterloo.\n\nThe Island Line Trains service runs from Ryde Pier Head via Ryde Esplanade to Shanklin, a distance of 8.5 mi. Ryde St John's Road railway station lies further south in the town.\n\nThe bus interchange lies between Ryde Pier and the Hover Terminal on the Esplanade. Ryde is the second busiest stop in the Southern Vectis network after Newport. The busiest route is No. 9 to Newport, running every 10 minutes in the daytime. Others include Nos 2, 3, 4 and 8 and local route 37. An open-top bus service, The Downs Tour, runs in the summer.\n\nAmenities\n\nThe town's large and long esplanade area has always been an attraction for tourists, especially those day-tripping from the mainland, as the amenities are all available by walking from the pier. A swimming pool, bowls club, bowling alley, and boating lake are among the attractions, and there are various children's playgrounds, amusement arcades and caf\u00e9s.\n\nRyde has few large public open spaces beyond the esplanade, but areas for public recreation include Appley Park, Puckpool Park, Vernon Square, Simeon Street Recreation Ground, St John's Park, St Thomas' churchyard, Salter Road recreation ground, and Oakfield Football Club.\n\nAt one time Ryde had two separate piers; the other being the Victoria Pier, no longer in existence. Ryde has its own inshore rescue service, which mostly deals with people stranded on sandbanks as the incoming tide cuts them off from the shore. The pier is also a feature on the 67 mi Isle of Wight Coastal Path, which is marked with blue signs bearing a white seagull.\n\nRyde has a small marina located to the east of Ryde Pier. It is tidal and dries out at low water, hence it is more suitable for smaller sailing (bilge keel) and motor cruisers. It has provision for up to 200 boats, either on floating pontoons or leaning against the harbour wall. It has a full-time harbour master, who posts information outside the harbour office, including weather reports, tide times, cruise-liner movements and anniversary events.\n\nThe town centre is on a hill, with local shops and chain retailers.\n\nBuildings\n\nThe twin church spires visible from the sea belong to All Saints' (the taller) and Holy Trinity churches. All Saints' Church is located in Queens Road on a road junction known as Five Ways. It was designed by George Gilbert Scott and completed in 1872. The spire is 54 m tall. Holy Trinity Church is in Dover Street. It was designed by Thomas Hellyer and completed in 1845. Holy Trinity Church closed in January 2014 and the building became the Aspire Ryde community centre.\n\nSt James' is a further Church of England church in the centre of Ryde, on Lind Street. It was constructed in 1827 as a proprietary chapel and continues to be active, with services at 10:30am and 6:30pm each Sunday and a range of youth and mid-week groups.\n\nThe town's Roman Catholic church, St Mary's in High Street, was built in 1846 at a cost of \u00a318,000, provided by Elizabeth, Countess of Clare. It was designed by Joseph Hansom, inventor of the hansom cab. Other churches include the Anglican St James Church and St. Michael and All Angels, Swanmore. There are also Baptist, Methodist, United Reformed and Elim churches in the town.\n\nRyde Castle, situated on the Esplanade, was built about 1840 as a private house in crenellated style and is now a hotel. It was heavily damaged by a fire in 2012 and underwent major restoration in 2013.\n\nBeldornie Tower on Augusta Road was at one point a property of the Earl of Yarborough. Dating back to the 16th or early 17th century, the house was virtually rebuilt about 1840 in Gothic-Jacobean style. A west wing was added in 1880.\n\nRyde School With Upper Chine stands opposite All Saints' Church. The chief building, Westmont, is Grade II listed.\n\nEntertainment\n\nSited on the Esplanade are an ice rink and a pavilion. The former is no longer open to the public, and the Isle of Wight's ice-hockey team, the Wightlink Raiders, has disbanded. The pavilion houses a bowling alley and night club.\n\nThe town's local football team, for many years Ryde Sports F.C., has given way to Ryde Saints F.C. and Ryde F.C.\n\nSpeedway is staged just south of the town at Smallbrook Stadium. The Isle of Wight Islanders started as members of the Conference League before moving up to the Premier League.\n\nCarnivals\n\nRyde has five carnivals in a typical year: the Mardi Gras in June (known as the Arts Parade from 2003 to 2012), Children's, Main and Illuminated processions at the end of August, and a Lantern Parade in December. The Carnival at Ryde is England's oldest.",
  "Leh\u2013Manali Highway\n\nThe Leh\u2013Manali Highway is a 428 km long highway in northernmost India connecting Leh, the capital of the union territory of Ladakh, to Manali in the state of Himachal Pradesh. It connects the Manali Solang valley to the Lahaul and Spiti valleys in Himachal Pradesh and the Zanskar valley in Ladakh. It is open for about six months in a year, from first week of May (when the snow is cleared from the highway) to October, when snowfall again blocks the high passes on the highway. However, the Lahaul valley now remains connected to Manali for most part of the year through already completed Atal tunnel. With the completion of proposed Shingo La Tunnel on new route through Zanskar valley, targeted to be completed by 2025, the whole Leh-Manali route will become all-weather road.\n\nThe Leh\u2013Manali Highway acts as a trunk route for various India-China Border Roads in Ladakh and Himachal. It has been designed, built and being maintained by the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) of the Indian army. It supports the heaviest army vehicles.\n\nHistory\n\nThe work on the Leh-Manali road was started in 1964. To achieve maximum speed, its construction was taken up from both ends. In 1989, the 473-km Manali-Leh road began serving as the second land approach to Ladakh.\n\nGeographical features\n\nThe average elevation of Leh-Manali highway is more than 4,000 m (13,000 feet) and its highest elevation is 5328 m at the Taglang La mountain pass. It is flanked by mountain ranges on both sides, featuring stunning sand and natural rock formations. The landscape changes after getting past the Atal tunnel and the greenery starts receding upon entering the Chandra river valley in the Lahaul region that lies in the rain-shadow. After crossing Darcha, the greenery completely disappears and the mountain slopes on the leeward side become brown and arid. Most of the mountain peaks and highway Passes north of Darcha remains covered by snow even in summer and shine brightly in the sun. Adjacent glaciers melt (more so as the day wears on) and water overruns the highway in many places. This water is ice-cold and travellers should avoid situations where they might have to wade through it.\n\nRoad surface\n\nThe Leh-Manali highway is generally two lanes wide (one lane in each direction) without a road divider, but has only one or one and a half lanes at some stretches. Snow and rain can make the highway slushy or too slippery to travel. Past precipitation can also create travel hazards. It has over a dozen Bailey bridges and all of them are now being upgraded to two-lane steel bridges. The highway crosses many streams of ice-cold water from snow-capped mountains and glacial melts without a bridge and it requires driving skill to negotiate fast-flowing streams. The highway has many damaged stretches and under-maintained portions, where even a little rainfall can trigger dangerous landslides. The road quality is poor from Zingzingbar to Pang and one has to drive carefully as high speed can cause discomfort.\n\nClimate\n\nLadakh is a cold semi-arid desert. It is cold along the highway even in summer (May onwards); the days are warm in bright sunshine but the nights are very cold. Light woollens are required during the day and thick woollens are required at night. There is minimal rainfall between Darcha and Leh even during the monsoon season in July\u2013September as the entire region lies in rain shadow.\n\nLength of highway\n\nThe total length of the highway is about 428 km. It has 178 km in Himachal Pradesh as the length in Himachal Pradesh is shorten by about 45 km after opening of the Atal Tunnel avoiding the Rohtang Pass, and 250 km (156 mi) in Ladakh. The state line is at Sarchu.\n\nEarlier Route\n\nIn Himachal Pradesh: After this, there is main route from Sissu as mentioned above.\n\nTravel time\n\nAfter opening of Atal Tunnel, the journey from Manali to Leh normally requires one overnight stay en-route  (Overnight accommodations are described below). Travel time is unpredictable since the weather and road conditions can change suddenly. However, it is now possible to cover the entire journey from Manali to Leh in 14-16 hrs in a single day, if there are no road blockades and traffic jams en-route.\n\nThe peak travel season is during May-June and September-October, when tourists visit Atal tunnel, Rohtang pass and Lahaul valley. Most domestic tourists return to Manali on the same day. The Himachal Road Transport Corporation (HRTC) and the Himachal Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation (HPTDC) both operate buses that travel the entire highway in two days. Buses start from Manali at 4 am until 6 pm. The travel time from Manali to Keylong is now approximately 2 hours via Atal tunnel. Private four-wheel drive taxis are available. Shared taxis are cheap as they charge per person, but they may be full of local residents. The tourist cannot stop either a bus or a shared taxi for sightseeing. Many Bikers travel from Manali to Leh and elsewhere in Ladakh on motorcycles, generally in a group.\n\nFuel stations\n\nEarlier, there was no fuel station for 330 km between Tandi and Karu. Now, a new fuel station at Keylong has become operational since September 2021. Motorists and bikers should fill up at the start of this stretch. The motorcycles and vehicles with small tanks should carry additional fuel in cans. In an emergency, fuel may be available at villages and campsites en route (Jispa, Zingzingbar, Sarchu, Pang etc.), but this fuel may be adulterated and costly.\n\nAltitude sickness\n\nAt high altitudes, the air is thinner and contains less oxygen. Acute mountain sickness is possible, whose symptoms include headache, nausea, dizziness, and vomiting. It can be fatal. If reaching the area by air from lower terrain, the traveller should acclimate to the high altitude by staying at least one night at the starting point (typically Manali), and plan to stay over at either Keylong, Jispa or Darcha before ascending to the highway's highest passes and plains after Darcha. Travellers should minimise the time spent at the high altitudes and therefore not stay over at Sarchu or Pang. They should carry chocolates, glucose or other high-energy food on the journey.\n\nAccommodation\n\nThere are a variety of hotels to suit all budgets at the highway's endpoints, Manali and Leh. There are also hotels and PWD rest houses at Sissu and at Keylong (a district headquarter). There is one luxury hotel at Jispa.\n\nGuesthouses are available at Sissu, Keylong, Jispa, Rumtse, Upshi and Karu.\n\nThe remaining option is to sleep in a tent which are generally basic and inexpensive. Luxury and comfortable tents (Swiss-cottage tents) are available in Jispa and Sarchu. Tent accommodations are also available in Darcha, Zingzingbar, Bharatpur (below Baralacha La pass, inhabited only during tourist season) and Pang. In India, a dhaba is a roadside eatery with low prices and no frills. These are found at some otherwise uninhabited places along the highway. Dhabas are not motels, but many let customers lie down and rest, and some can provide an inexpensive dormitory bed (without private toilet).",

  "Por-Bazhyn\n\nPor-Bazhyn (Por-Bajin, Por-Bazhyng, \u041f\u043e\u0440-\u0411\u0430\u0436\u044b\u043d, Tuvan: \u041f\u043e\u0440-\u0411\u0430\u0436\u044b\u04a3) is a ruined structure on a lake island high in the mountains of southern Tuva (Russian Federation). The name derives. Excavations suggest that it was built as a Uyghur palace in the 8th century AD, converted into a Manichaean monastery soon after, abandoned after a short occupation, and finally destroyed by an earthquake and subsequent fire. Its construction methods show that Por-Bazhyn was built within the Tang Chinese architectural tradition.\n\nLocation and description\n\nPor-Bazhyn occupies a small island in Lake Tere-Khol, about 1,300 m above sea level in the Sengelen mountains of southern Siberia. The location is 8 km west of the village of Kungurtuk in the southeast of the Republic of Tuva (Russian Federation), close to the Russian border with Mongolia.\n\nThe walls of the site enclose a rectangular area of 215 x 162 m, oriented east\u2013west and covering almost the entire island. The interior is taken up by two large yards, a central building complex, and a chain of small yards along the northern, western and southern walls. The western and eastern curtain walls are relatively well preserved. The main gate, with gate towers and ramps leading up to them, is located in the middle of the eastern wall. The curtain (outer) walls have survived up to a maximum height of 10 m, the maximum surviving height of the inner walls is 1 \u2013 1.5 m.\n\nHistory of research and identifications\n\nPor-Bazhyn has been known since the 18th century, and was explored in 1891 for the first time. In 1957\u20131963, the Russian archaeologist S.I. Vajnstejn excavated in several areas of the site. Large-scale fieldwork was undertaken in 2007\u20132008 by the Fortress Por-Bajin Foundation, with scholars and scientists from the Russian Academy of Sciences, the State Oriental Museum, and Moscow State University.\n\nSince the end of the 19th century, Por-Bazhyn has been linked to the Uyghurs because of its location, the date of finds from it, and the similarity of its lay-out to the palace complex of Karabalgasun, the capital of the Uyghur Khaganate. Vajnstejn identified Por-Bazhyn as the \u2018palace.. at the well\u2019 built, according to the runic inscription on the Selenga stone, by Khagan Moyanchur (also known as Bayanchur Khan, AD 747-759), after his victory over local tribes in AD 750. Moyanchur involved the Uyghur Khaganate in internal power struggles in China, and married a Chinese princess. Other identifications of the site included a border fortress, a monastery, a ritual site, and an astronomical observatory; these are found in older literature published before the conclusion of modern fieldwork in 2008.\n\nResults of fieldwork 2007\u20132008\n\nGeophysicists found that the island is essentially a plug of permafrost in a shallow lake. This island seems to have risen from the lake several centuries before the fortress was built on it. The clay for the walls of the fortress may have been taken from the lake bed around the island. Geomorphological fieldwork also revealed traces of at least two earthquakes. The first of these seems to have already happened during the construction of the fortress in the 8th century. In the late Middle Ages, another catastrophic earthquake led to fires and to the collapse of the southern and eastern enclosure walls and of the northwestern corner bastion.\n\nThe outer wall of the enclosure was built using the Chinese hangtu technique (rammed-earth layers in a wooden frame) and was originally 11 m high. The excavation of the northern bastion on the eastern wall revealed traces of a wooden fighting platform running along the top of the curtain wall and bastions. The main gate was found to have three gateways of heavy timber construction, much of it burnt. It opened into two successive courtyards which were connected by a small gate. The outer courtyard was devoid of all structures.\n\nThe inner courtyard held the main complex which consisted of a two-part central structure and two flanking galleries. The two buildings of the central structure, one behind the other, stood on square platforms which had been built up of clay layers and faced with bricks which were coated with lime plaster. The larger building was subdivided by wattle-and-daub panels into two halls and a series of smaller rooms. Walls and panels were covered with lime plaster which was painted with geometric designs and horizontal red stripes; the presence of two layers of plaster of different quality suggests repairs. The tiled roof had been supported by 36 wooden columns resting on stone bases. The building appeared to be of post-and-beam construction characteristic of Chinese Tang architecture; this is indicated by burnt timber fragments of interlocking wooden brackets in the Chinese style called dougong. The decorative eave end-tiles recovered from the site are broadly analogous to those found in Tang contexts, however recent studies indicate they form part of a distinctive Uyghur stylistic typology.\n\nA series of small enclosed courtyards ran along the interior of the northern, western and southern curtain walls; these courtyards were connected to one another by small gates in their walls. Each courtyard held a one- or two-chamber building of similar lay-out and building method.\n\nDating and interpretation of the site\n\nEarly dendrochronology and radiocarbon dating studies indicated that the \u2018fortress\u2019 was built between AD 770 and 790. The excavators point out that this was in the reign of Uyghur B\u00f6g\u00fc Qaghan, successor of Moyanchur, therefore Por-Bazhyn cannot have been the palace mentioned in the Selenga inscription. The date of the palace's construction was later refined further to around AD 777.\n\nA Chinese presence or influence at Por-Bazhyn is shown by the lay-out of the central complex in Tang style; the use of Chinese construction methods, such as the hangtu technique and dougong ceilings; and the presence of Chinese building materials, such as certain types of roof tiles. Por-Bazhyn combines the lay-out of the Chinese \u2018ideal town\u2019, with axial planning and a dominant central building, with that of the \u2018ideal Buddhist monastery\u2019, with living quarters along the inner perimeter of the enclosure walls.\n\nUsing the latest update of the palace being built in 777, the excavators suggest that this was a summer palace built by Khagan B\u00f6g\u00fc which, after damage to the palace by an earthquake and the Khagan's conversion to Manichaeism, was converted into a Manichaean monastery. Following his death in 780 and the abolition of Manichaeism afterwards, the monastery was abandoned. The empty site was later destroyed by one or more earthquakes and extensive fires in the central complex and elsewhere on the site.\n\nModern significance of Por-Bazhyn\n\nThe fieldwork at Por-Bazhyn in 2007 and 2008 was followed with great interest in Uyghur media, and a delegation of the Uyghur Cultural Centre (Kazakhstan) visited the site during the excavations in 2007. Being without a national state of their own today, the modern Uyghurs derive an essential element of their cultural identity from the past greatness of the Uyghur Khaganate.\n\nThe native Tuvinian Sergey Shoygu, then Minister for Emergencies of the Russian Federation, was chairman of the Por-Bazhyn Fortress Foundation which provided the funding for the fieldwork. In August 2007, he visited the excavations together with Vladimir Putin, then Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, and Albert II, Prince of Monaco.",

  "Pyrotol\n\nPyrotol was an explosive available for a time after World War I. It was reprocessed from military surplus, with a typical composition of 60% smokeless powder, 34% sodium nitrate, and 6% of 40% nitroglycerin dynamite. Usually used in combination with dynamite, it created an incendiary blast. Since it was very inexpensive, it was often used by farmers to remove tree stumps and clear ditches. The substance was known for being used to commit the Bath School bombing in 1927. Distribution of pyrotol for farm use was discontinued in 1928, due to exhaustion of the supply of surplus explosives.\n\nPyrotol was intended to make a use after the war for a large surplus of smokeless powder. It was manufactured in a contract awarded to the DuPont Company and was created in three DuPont plants: Gibbstown, N.J., Barksdale, Wisconsin, and DuPont, Washington. The active ingredient of these cartridges, Pyrotol, was free, and included in the cartridge's price; the consumer paid for the preparation and freight of these cartridges.\n\nPyrotol was said to cause no ill effects, like headaches, or staining hands or clothing, although the validity of this statement is unknown. A 6 oz cartridge of pyrotol was said to be as powerful as an 8 oz cartridge of dynamite, and came in 50 lb boxes containing 160 cartridges of the substance.",

  "Compitalia\n\nIn ancient Roman religion, the Compitalia (Latin: Ludi Compitalicii) was an annual festival in honor of the Lares Compitales, household deities of the crossroads, to whom sacrifices were offered at the places where two or more ways met. The word comes from the Latin compitum, a cross-way.\n\nThis festival is more ancient than the building of Rome. It is said by some writers to have been instituted by Tarquinius Priscus in consequence of the miracle attending the birth of Servius Tullius, who was supposed to be the son of a Lar Familiaris, or family guardian deity.\n\nDionysius says that Servius Tullius founded the festival, which he describes as it was celebrated in his time. Dionysius relates that the sacrifices consisted of honey-cakes (\u03c0\u03ad\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9) presented by the inhabitants of each house; and that the people who assisted as ministering servants at the festival were not free men, but slaves, because the Lares took pleasure in the service of slaves. He further adds that the Compitalia were celebrated a few days after the Saturnalia with great splendor, and that the slaves on this occasion had full liberty to do as they pleased.\n\nDuring the celebration of the festival, each family placed the statue of the underworld goddess Mania at the door of their house. They also hung up at their doors figures of wool representing men and women, accompanying them with humble requests that the Lares and Mania would be contented with those figures, and spare the people of the house. Slaves offered balls or fleeces of wool instead of human figures.\n\nMacrobius says that the celebration of the Compitalia was restored by the Etruscan king Tarquinius Superbus in response to an oracle that \"they should sacrifice heads (capita) for heads.\" The oracle was taken to mean that in order to maintain the health and prosperity of each family, children should be sacrificed to Mania, identified in this case as the mother of the Lares. But Brutus, after overthrowing the line of Tarquin kings, instead satisfied the oracle by exploiting a verbal loophole, substituting \"heads\" of garlic and poppies.\n\nThe people who presided over the festival were magistri vici (\"neighborhood officers\") and on that occasion were allowed to wear the toga praetexta. Public games were added to the festival during the Republican period, but they were suppressed by command of the senate in 68 BCE. Calpurnius Piso was charged by Cicero with violating the decree by allowing the games to be celebrated during his consulship in 58. The festival itself still continued to be observed, even if the games were abolished.\n\nDuring the civil wars of the 40s, the festival fell into disuse, and was accordingly restored during the program of religious reforms carried out by Augustus. As Augustus was now the pater patriae, the worship of the old Lares was discontinued, and the Lares of the emperor consequently became the Lares of the state. Augustus set up Lares or penates at places where two or more ways met and instituted an order of priests to attend to their worship. These priests were chosen from the libertini, people who had been legally freed from slavery, and were called Augustales.\n\nThe Compitalia belonged to the feriae conceptivae, that is, festivals which were celebrated on days appointed annually by the magistrates or priests. The exact day on which this festival was celebrated appears to have varied, though it was always in the winter, at least in the time of Varro, as observed by Isaac Casaubon. Dionysius again relates that it was celebrated a few days after the Saturnalia, and Cicero that it fell on the Kalends of January; but in one of his letters to Atticus, he speaks of it as occurring on the fourth before the Nones of January (January 2). The exact words with which the festival was announced are preserved by Macrobius and Aulus Gellius:\n\nDie noni popolo romano quiritibus compitalia erunt.\n\nSuetonius writes that Augustus ordered the Lares Compitales crowned twice yearly with spring and summer flowers (\"Compitales Lares ornari bis anno instituit vernis floribus et aestivis\").",

  "Adolf Busemann\n\nAdolf Busemann (20 April 1901 \u2013 3 November 1986) was a German aerospace engineer and influential Nazi-era pioneer in aerodynamics, specialising in supersonic airflows. He introduced the concept of swept wings and, after emigrating in 1947 to the United States under Operation Paperclip, invented the shockwave-free supersonic Busemann biplane.\n\nEducation and early life\n\nBorn in L\u00fcbeck, Germany, Busemann attended the Technical University of Braunschweig, receiving his Ph.D. in engineering in 1924.\n\nCareer and research\n\nThe next year he was given the position of aeronautical research scientist at the Max-Planck Institute where he joined the famed team led by Ludwig Prandtl, including Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n, Max Munk and Jakob Ackeret. In 1930 he was promoted to professor at University of G\u00f6ttingen. He held various positions within the German scientific community during this period, and during the war he was the director of the Braunschweig Laboratory, a famous research establishment.\n\nBusemann discovered the benefits of the swept wing for aircraft at high speeds, presenting a paper on the topic at the Volta Conference in Rome in 1935. The paper concerned supersonic flow only. At the time of his proposal, flight much beyond 300 miles per hour had not been achieved and it was considered an academic curiosity. Nevertheless, he continued working with the concept, and by the end of the year had demonstrated similar benefits in the transonic region as well. As director of the Braunschweig labs, he started an experimental wind tunnel test series of the concept, and by 1942 had amassed a considerable amount of useful technical data. As the need for higher speed aircraft became pressing in Germany, the Messerschmitt Me P.1101 was developed to flight test these designs.\n\nWhen World War II ended, a team of American aerodynamicists travelled to Germany as part of Operation Lusty. The team included von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n, Tsien Hsue-shen, Hugh Dryden and George S. Schairer from Boeing. They reached the Braunschweig labs on 7 May, where they found a mass of data on the swept wing concept. When they asked Busemann about it, \"his face lit up\" and he said, \"Oh, you remember, I read a paper on it at the Volta Conference in 1935\". Several members of the team did remember the presentation, but had completely forgotten the details in terms of what the presentation was actually about. Realizing its importance, Schairer immediately wrote to Boeing and told them to investigate the concept, leading to a re-modeling of the B-47 Stratojet with a swept wing. Busemann's work, along with similar work by Robert T. Jones in the US, led to a revolution in aircraft design.\n\nNear the end of the war, Busemann started studies of airflow around delta wings, leading to the development of his supersonic conical flow theory. This reduced the complexity of the airflow to a conformal mapping in the complex plane, and was used for some time in the industry.\n\nBusemann moved to the United States in 1947 and started work at NACA's Langley Research Center. In 1951 he gave a talk where he described the fact that air at near supersonic speeds no longer varied in diameter with speed according to Bernoulli's theorem but remained largely incompressible and acting as fixed diameter pipes, or as he put it,'streampipes'. He jokingly referred to aerodynamicists as needing to become 'pipe fitters'. This talk led an attendee, Richard Whitcomb, to try and work out what these pipes were doing in a transonic test he was performing, inventing the Whitcomb area rule a few days later.\n\nAt Langley, he worked primarily on the problems of sonic booms, and spent a considerable amount of effort looking at ways to characterize them, and potentially eliminate them. He later invented Busemann's Biplane, a supersonic design he originally proposed in 1936 that emits no shock waves and has no wave drag, at the cost of having no lift. Busemann also did early work on magneto-hydrodynamics in the 1920s, as well as on cylindrical focusing of shock waves and non-steady gas dynamics.\n\nBusemann held a professorship at the University of Colorado from 1963 and suggested the use of ceramic tiles on the Space Shuttle, which were adopted by NASA.\n\nAwards and honors\n\nHe was awarded the Ludwig-Prandtl-Ring from the Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Luft- und Raumfahrt (German Society for Aeronautics and Astronautics) for \"outstanding contribution in the field of aerospace engineering\" in 1966. He died at age 85 in Boulder, Colorado.",

  "Acicular ferrite\n\nAcicular ferrite is a microstructure of ferrite in steel that is characterised by needle-shaped crystallites or grains when viewed in two dimensions. The grains, actually three-dimensional in shape, have a thin lenticular shape. This microstructure is advantageous over other microstructures because of its chaotic ordering, which increases toughness.\n\nAcicular ferrite is formed in the interior of the original austenitic grains by direct nucleation on the inclusions, resulting in randomly oriented short ferrite needles with a 'basket weave' appearance. Acicular ferrite is also characterised by high angle boundaries between the ferrite grains. This further reduces the chance of cleavage, because these boundaries impede crack propagation.\n\nIn C-Mn steel weld metals, it is reported that nucleation of various ferrite morphologies is aided by non-metallic inclusion; in particular oxygen-rich inclusions of a certain type and size are associated with the intragranular nucleation of acicular ferrite, as observed, for example, by,. Acicular ferrite is a fine Widmanst\u00e4tten constituent, which is nucleated by an optimum intragranular dispersion of oxide/sulfide/silicate particles. The interlocking nature of acicular ferrite, together with its fine grain size (0.5 to 5 \u03bcm with aspect ratio from 3:1 to 10:1), provides maximum resistance to crack propagation by cleavage.\n\nComposition control of weld metal is often performed to maximise the volume fraction of acicular ferrite due to the toughness it imparts. During continuous cooling, higher alloy contents or faster cooling generally delay transformation, which will then take place at lower temperatures, below the bainite start temperature, and lead to higher hardness. The efficacy of inclusions as nucleation sites in modern low alloy steel weld metals is such that fine-scale intragranular bainite can nucleate on them, both by continuous cooling and by isothermal transformation below the bainite start temperature. Some confusion has arisen in the literature, as this fine-scale intragranular bainite, which can resemble acicular ferrite in appearance in the optical microscope, has been called acicular ferrite by some researchers.

  "Cure Rare Disease\n\nCure Rare Disease is a non-profit biotechnology company based in Boston, Massachusetts that is working to create novel therapeutics using gene therapy, gene editing (CRISPR technology) and antisense oligonucleotides to treat people impacted by rare and ultra-rare genetic neuromuscular conditions.\n\nHistory\n\nRichard Horgan founded Terry's Foundation for Muscular Dystrophy in 2017, which became Cure Rare Disease in 2018, in order to develop a cure for Duchenne muscular dystrophy for his brother who has been battling the disease since childhood. Leveraging his network from Harvard Business School, Horgan formed a collaboration consisting of leading researchers and clinicians around the country to develop this cure for his brother, and eventually founded Cure Rare Disease.\n\nHorgan connected first with a scientist at Boston Children's Hospital, Dr. Timothy Yu, who had just successfully created a custom drug for a girl with the neurodegenerative condition, Batten disease using antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) technology. Horgan's brother's mutation is not amenable to ASO technology, so Horgan adopted the process and instead used CRISPR as the technology to attempt to cure his brother.\n\nThis collaboration has expanded over the past three years and has led to the addition of notable researchers and institutions collaborating with Cure Rare Disease on their mission to treat rare disease.\n\nResearch\n\nThere are currently three drugs approved by the FDA for Duchenne muscular dystrophy to treat the patients with mutations on the dystrophin gene encompassing exon 51, 53, and 45. However, people with DMD have mutations impacting different exons of the gene, so these do not work to treat all patients.\n\nCure Rare Disease is developing novel therapeutics using gene replacement, gene editing (CRISPR gene-editing) and antisense oligonucleotide technologies. To systemically deliver\u00a0 a subset of therapeutics, including CRISPR, the therapeutic is inserted into the adeno-associated virus (AAV). The drug developed for Horgan\u2019s brother used a CRISPR transcriptional activator which functions to upregulate an alternative isoform of dystrophin. Because the CRISPR activation technology does not induce a double stranded cut, rather it acts to upregulate the target of interest, there is less risk of introducing an off-target genetic mutation. Through the collaboration with Cure Rare Disease, researchers at Charles River Laboratories, headquartered in Wilmington, Massachusetts, have develop animal models with the same genetic mutation as the person to be treated with the drug so that therapeutic efficacy and safety can be shown.\n\nAfter extensive efficacy and safety testing, Cure Rare Disease secured approval of the Investigational New Drug (IND) application from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to dose Terry with the first-in-human CRISPR transcriptional activator in July 2022.\n\nFinding success in developing a novel framework to treat the first patient, Cure Rare Disease expanded the development of additional therapeutics. Currently, there are 18 mutations and conditions in the Cure Rare Disease pipeline, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy, various subtypes of Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), and ADSSL1 distal myopathy. As of 2022, none of these conditions have a viable treatment available for the population impacted. To better plan for future therapeutic endeavors, Cure Rare Disease established a patient registry where patients and patient families can input their mutation information.\n\nPartners\n\nThe cross-functional collaboration includes researchers and clinicians from across the Northern Hemisphere and is focused on developing therapeutics for rare and ultra-rare diseases for which there are no effective treatments.",

  "1997\u201398 Colchester United F.C. season\n\nThe 1997\u201398 season was Colchester United's 56th season in their history and their sixth consecutive season in the fourth tier of English football, the Third Division. Alongside competing in the Third Division, the club also participated in the FA Cup, the League Cup and the Football League Trophy.\n\nColchester ended the season with a strong finish, one point shy of automatic promotion in fourth place. This meant another attempt at promotion via the play-offs. Colchester faced Barnet in the semi-final first leg, and they lost 1\u20130 at Underhill Stadium. In the return leg at Layer Road, Colchester won 3\u20131 to defeat Barnet 3\u20132 on aggregate thus achieving a place in the final and a second trip to Wembley in a year. In the final, the U's faced Torquay United. A David Gregory penalty was enough to separate the sides and promote Colchester to the third tier of English football for the first time in 17 years.\n\nDespite reaching the final of the Football League Trophy the season prior, Colchester were knocked out at the first round stage by Leyton Orient this term. They suffered a same fate at the hands of Luton Town in the League Cup and saw a second round exit in the FA Cup to Hereford United.\n\nSeason overview\n\nColchester were eliminated at the first round stage of the League Cup, and also the first round of the Football League Trophy after reaching the 1997 Final. They once again lost to a non-League side in Hereford United in the FA Cup second round following a replay.\n\nThe club were awarded a settlement of \u00a3300,000 from Ipswich Town owing to the saga over George Burley's acrimonious exit from Colchester to their Suffolk neighbours in late 1994. Meanwhile, Alfred McAlpine were named as the consultants commissioned for the process of building a new stadium for Colchester United, with the club's lease on Layer Road due to expire in 2002.\n\nManager Steve Wignall broke the club's transfer record by spending \u00a350,000 on Neil Gregory, who joined from Ipswich Town to reunite with his brother David.\n\nColchester's had a late season upturn in form, winning ten of their final 15 games as they missed automatic promotion by just one point. This meant that they had qualified for the play-offs, where they would face seventh-placed Barnet, who themselves earned a place in the play-offs by just one point ahead of Scunthorpe United.\n\nBarnet won the first-leg at Underhill Stadium 1\u20130, but both sides were reduced to ten men in the game after Guy Branston was sent off for the U's and Sean Devine saw red for Barnet. Colchester won the Layer Road leg 3\u20131 after extra time with goals from David Gregory and David Greene. Barnet also had Lee Howarth sent off on 60 minutes while Barnet were leading 2\u20131 on aggregate.\n\nThe win took Colchester to Wembley for the second time in a year and a third trip in six years. The fixture was moved to Friday night to accommodate an England versus Saudi Arabia friendly, and as such attracted a relatively low crowd of 19,486. The game was also broadcast on Sky Sports. David Gregory converted from the penalty spot on 22 minutes to win the match 1\u20130 for Colchester and earn promotion back to the third tier of English football for the first time in 17 years.\n\nResults round by round\n\n{{#invoke:sports rbr table|table|legendpos=b\n\n}}\n\nAppearances and goals\n\n!colspan=\"16\"|Players who appeared for Colchester who left during the season\n\nClean sheets\n\nNumber of games goalkeepers kept a clean sheet.\n\nPlayer debuts\n\nPlayers making their first-team Colchester United debut in a fully competitive match.\n\nGeneral\n\nBooks\n\nWebsites",

He became the governor of the Yemen in 816, but he subsequently led a rebellion against the central government, which lasted until his defeat and capture in 820.\n\nCareer\n\nHamdawayh was the son of Ali ibn Isa ibn Mahan, a former leader of the abna' and the long-serving governor of Khurasan during the caliphate of Harun al-Rashid ((r. 786 \u2013 809)). He himself first appears in 815, when he was an officer serving among forces loyal to al-Hasan ibn Sahl in southern Iraq, during the tumultuous period in the aftermath of the civil war between the rival caliphs al-Amin ((r. 809 \u2013 813)) and al-Ma'mun ((r. 813 \u2013 833)). Following the death of the pro-Alid rebel Abu al-Saraya al-Sirri in late 815, Hamdawayh was appointed by al-Hasan as governor of the Yemen, which was then in the hands of the Alid Ibrahim ibn Musa al-Jazzar, and tasked with recovering the province for al-Ma'mun. After arriving in Mecca alongside the caliph's brother Abu Ishaq (the future caliph al-Mu'tasim, (r. 833 \u2013 842)), who had been put in charge of the pilgrimage of 816, Hamdawayh advanced upon the Yemen and met Ibrahim's forces in battle. Ibrahim was defeated and forced to flee, allowing Hamdawayh to take control of Sana'a and the Yemeni highlands.\n\nFollowing al-Ma'mun's designation of Ibrahim ibn Musa's brother Ali ibn Musa al-Rida as his successor in 817, the central government reconciled with Ibrahim and formally invested him with the governorship of the Yemen. This act was opposed, however, by Hamdawayh and many of the Yemenis, who refused to recognize the appointment. When Ibrahim marched toward Sana'a in 818, Hamdawayh went out to meet him with his army, and in a sharp engagement defeated the Alid and killed a large number of his men. Ibrahim was compelled to retreat to Mecca, and Hamdawayh retained command of the province, though now as a rebel.\n\nHamdawayh's rule in the Yemen lasted until 820, when al-Ma'mun appointed Isa ibn Yazid al-Juludi as governor of the province. Isa advanced south and routed Hamdawayh's forces in battle, forcing Hamdawayh to withdraw and seek refuge in Sana'a. Isa, however, pursued him and entered the town, and eventually found where the rebel was staying. Hamdawayh was then captured and placed under arrest, and shortly afterwards he was dispatched to al-Ma'mun in Baghdad.\n\nEstablishment of the Ziyadids\n\nDuring Hamdawayh's governorship, the caliphal general Muhammad ibn Abdallah ibn Ziyad established his rule over the Tihamah region of western Yemen. This area subsequently remained under the control of the Ziyadid dynasty, and the authority of succeeding governors of Yemen proper was restricted to Sana'a and the highlands of the country.",
  "Sometimes a Fantasy\n\n\"Sometimes a Fantasy\" is a song by Billy Joel released as the last single from his album Glass Houses. The single peaked at #36 on the US Billboard Hot 100.\n\nThe song is a \"melodic, fast paced rocker.\" It starts with Joel dialing a number on a telephone (which he is depicted doing on the single cover). The lyrics are about a sexually frustrated man who tries to convince his significant other to have phone sex. He explains that he is lonely since they are far away from each other (which is implied by the fact that his phone call is \"long distance\").\n\nMusic video\n\nThe video starts with Joel in bed, dialing a woman's number. She then picks up the phone and the music starts playing. While on the phone, Joel sings the song's lyrics to her throughout the video. Then, in the end, it turns out the entire call was just a fantasy, and no one picked up.\n\nOther versions\n\nThe single version of \"Sometimes a Fantasy\" released in the United States and Canada has a running time of 4:19, making it longer than the album version, which runs at 3:40. The 45 RPM single also uses a different mix with guitars panned in different locations. The album's version ends with a fade out, while the single version does not, and instead includes Joel letting loose a Beatles' honoring yowl of \"I got blisters on my blisters!\", a reference to Ringo Starr's outburst, \"I got blisters on my fingers\" at the end of \"Helter Skelter\".\n\nThe extended version of the song was available as a US 7\" vinyl, a Canadian 7\" vinyl, a US promo 7\" vinyl, a US DJ-promo 12\" vinyl and (at 4:22) as the Japanese B-side of \"All for Leyna\" (available as a 7\" and a 7\" promo).

  "Tibiao\n\nTibiao, officially the Municipality of Tibiao (Bayan ng Tibiao), is a 4th class municipality in the province of Antique, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 28,703 people.\n\nHistory\n\nDuring the Spanish times in the Philippines, Spanish soldiers encountered a group of natives in hatay hatay, a watery and miry land. They asked the natives the name of the place, pointing to the vast expanse of land covered with tall reed grasses called tigbaw. The natives, who thought the Spaniards were pertaining to the name of the grass, answered Tigbaw. It is near the edge of the present-day Tibiao River (sa Tib\u00ed Kang sub\u00e2). Sojourners to the place would comment: Tibi haw? It is a question asking why they locate themselves at the edge of the river. The term tib\u00ed haw eventually evolved into Tibiao. Since then the place was called Tibiao. Allegedly, the Spaniards had difficulty pronouncing the word Tigbaw.\n\nThe old settlement was in present-day Balanti-an. The natives had to relocate to the said place, since it was secluded and distant from the shore, and it was secure from piratical raids which were common during those days.\n\nTibiao was part of Nalupa from 1596 to 1840. Nalupa, with its central government in present-day Jinalinan controlled the area of what is now Tibiao, Barbaza, and Laua-an. In early 1730, Nalupa gradually depopulated due to the Moro pirate attacks. By 1733, Culasi had direct control of Nalupa and Pandan. In 1796, Nalupa ceded from Culasi. As an arrabal, notable village chieftains were Paris, Oguid Pagsuguiron, and Nicolas Amar (1818).\n\nIn 1786, Oguid Datu Oguid landed in the shores of Calawgan Creek. He brought with him his family and settlers from an unspecified place in Borneo, presumably from a place where Kinaray-a is the lingua franca.\n\nOn August 6, 1786, Oguid and his followers settled in, what is now, Kamyabsan or a place of guavas. Kamyabsan is now part of Sawang Sitio in Malabor. The site was near the shore and accessible to pirate raids. They later transferred to Balanti-an to coexist with the natives. When Datu Oguid arrived in Balanti-an, he was confronted by the \"Tumandoks\" but could not understand each other. In exchange, Datu Oguid offered foods to become acquainted with them which was termed Panguyang or Padu-um.\n\nIn 1815, Oguid sent a delegation to Nalupa to petition the Governor of Antique, Rafael Andres Gomez, to make Tibiao a new town separating from Nalupa. The petition was granted.\n\nOn January 1, 1818, Tibiao became a new town with Don Nicolas Amar as Teniente Municipal. The Governor of Antique that time was Juan Ormido while the Teniente Municipal of Nalupa was a certain Vislilla. Tibiao remained as a vista of Nalupa.\n\nIn 1826, Oguid was no longer the Teniente Municipal of Tibiao but he orchestrated the affairs of the town. On May 2, 1926, he called for a meeting where it was agreed to hold a Thanksgiving and to build a church in their settlement. The church was 20x10x4 yards in dimension with thatched palm leaf roofing and walls made of wooden slabs. The Teniente Municipal of Tibiao at that time was Juan Mariano.\n\nOn November 1, 1826, Oguid and Governor Martinez planted a cross on a mountain east of the settlement; the mountain is presently called Mount Cruz to commemorate the event. A Thanksgiving mass, mass wedding, and baptism were held the next day.\n\nOn November 6, 1828, Oguid chose five men to survey the proposed new town site. The site selected was between Calaugan and Palaypay creeks. It was Juan Amar Sarcino who drafted the town plan. The development of the site immediately began. A church and a convent were constructed, wooden bridges built to span the Calaugan and Palaypay creeks, road laids, drainage canals, and a cemetery were built. The Teniente Municipal at that time was Mariano Delos Santos while the Governor of Antique was Francisco Oreta.\n\nThe Parish of Tibiao was established by the Augustinian missionaries in 1849.\n\nIn 1851 Fr. Eulogio \"Oloy\" Cardones, a Filipino priest, was assigned as the parish priest of Tibiao. Fr. Cardones was the coadjutor bishop of the parish of Manduariao, Iloilo, before his assignment to Tibiao. The Arrival of Fr. Cardones was greeted with a fiesta celebration and a Panguyang. Tibiao is now an Independent Church,\n\nIn 1898, Pedro Bandoja (changed his name to Bandong) was the local revolutionary leader of the town.\n\nIn 1930, Nicolas Amarillo was re-elected Municipal President of Tibiao. He became a member of the National Association for Independence in Manila, which was formerly called \"Bag-ong Katipunan\" while in Manila, he was able to ask thru Rep. Segundo Moscoso aid of 10,000php for the construction of a Gabaldon type fourteen room building of the Tibiao Central School and Anastacia Gindap Espanola donated the Present Site of the Tibiao Central School, except the frontage.\n\nIn 1935, Before the end of Nicolas Amarillo Second Term, Amarillo asked the new governor of that time also from Tibiao, Governor Alejandro Lim to help him negotiate the Bishop of Jaro to donate a church property, for the Municipal Building.\n\nIn 1935, Alejandro Tario Lim was elected as Governor of the province, and known as Justice of the Peace of Tibiao, a lawyer by profession. After his term, he served as Labor Administrator of Department of Labor and Senior Legislator in Malaca\u00f1ang Palace. During his time as governor, he constructed Municipal Plaza and the Municipal Building.\n\nOn April 19, 1942, Japanese burned the church, municipal building, and the bridge.\n\nOn September 3, 1942, Lt. Absalon appointed Martin Juanillo as Mayor of Tibiao.\n\nOn November 13, 1942, Jose Mendoza Sr. Was Appointed Mayor of Tibiao by Pio Dioso.\n\nOn June 16, 1943, the Japanese patrol penetrated Tibiao.\n\nOn December 11, 1944, Heriberto Bandoja was appointed as municipal mayor of Tibiao by Calixto Zaldivar.\n\nIn 1948, Diodata Tario Lim Bandoja was elected as municipal mayor of Tibiao, sister of the former governor of the province, Gov. Alejandro T. Lim Sr, Tating is only elementary graduate. All her siblings were UP College Graduates. She was made to stop her education to take care of her parents. But she knew the importance of education so she donated eight hectares land and 40,000php for a school building. It was named Tario - Lim Memorial High school now University of Antique Tario Lim Memorial Campus in honor of her parents, Vicente \"Quin\" Sanches Lim and Maria Amar Tario.\n\nIn 1950, nineteen Huks were sighted in Dalanas. Soldiers of the Philippines Ground Force were detailed to Tibiao to fight the Huks. The Municipal Mayor Diodata Tario Lim Bandoja appointed four members of the local police named Manuel Bankaya, Conrado Antonio, Alejandro Amar and Samson Amar. They caught the eighteen Huks whose commander was Alyas 120.\n\nIn 1956, Federico Ruiz Elected as Municipal Mayor of Tibiao. He donated six hectares land of their cane land. Through the help of Tobias Fornier and Diodata Lim Bandoja they established the Tario - Lim Memorial Antique School of Fisheries.\n\nIn 1960, Remegio Vista represented the country in Mexico Summer Olympics. His burst of speed was noticed he was dubbed as \"The Fastest Man\" in the first 50 meters of the sprint races.\n\nIn 1976, Mylene Miciano Crowned as Lin-ay Kang Antique from Tibiao.\n\nIn 1981, Manuel M.

It is an indirect sequel to the game Legacy of the Ancients. Originally designed for the Commodore 64, the game was ported to the Apple II.\n\nPlot\n\nThe principal character in the game is first contacted by Princess Aylea in a dream-vision. They are told that the evil Baron Taragas from the Kingdom of Maelbane has conspired with a local baron, Baron Mantrek, to find a magical material called Blacksilver.

  "Kampung Naga\n\nKampung Naga Kampung Nagawir (\u1b8a\u1b99\u1baa\u1b95\u1ba5\u1b80\u200b\u200b\u1b94\u1b8c\u1b9d\u1ba4\u1b81) or Kampung Gawir (\u1b8a\u1b99\u1baa\u1b95\u1ba5\u1b80\u200b\u200b\u1b8c\u1b9d\u1ba4\u1b81) is a traditional indigenous Baduy Panamping ( 'the Outer Baduy group') hamlet located in the Neglasari Village area of Salawu district in Tasikmalaya Regency, West Java Province, Indonesia.\n\nKampung Naga is notable for its traditional houses which is characterized by its functionality, simplicity, modesty, and its use of natural thatched materials, and its quite faithful adherence to the harmony with the nature and environment.\n\nEtymology\n\nEtymologically, the term \"Kampung Naga\" is Baduy in origin. It is a short form of Kampung Nagawir, which means the village or settlement in canyon area. By the Sundanese people (an ethnic group who live side by side with Baduy people), these settlement is better known by its endonym; \u1b8a\u1b99\u1baa\u1b95\u1ba5\u1b80\u200b\u200b\u1b94\u1b8c\u1b9d\u1ba4\u1b81 (Kampung Nagawir) or \u1b8a\u1b99\u1baa\u1b95\u1ba5\u1b80\u200b\u200b\u1b8c\u1b9d\u1ba4\u1b81 (Kampung Gawir) instead of the Kampung Naga. As the sister language, those terms shared similar meaning in both Baduy and Sundanese languages.\n\nCommunity and traditions\n\nKampung Naga is a traditional village which is inhabited by Baduy Panamping community that holds a strong tradition of preserving the way of life their ancestors. The differences are quite visible when compared with other communities surrounding Kampung Naga. The community are living in an atmosphere of a traditional simplicity and environmental wisdom. The Kampung Naga community traditionally maintain the knowledge of their ancestors and their traditional lifestyles in a close harmony with nature, which extends to their construction methods; using local materials of timber, stone, bamboo, thatched materials and palm leaves.\n\nLocation\n\nKampung Naga is located not far from the main road that connects with the city of Garut and Tasikmalaya. Villages are located in a fertile valley, with the boundaries, in the West Village by Naga forest. The forest is considered sacred because it is hosts the ancestral cemetery. In the south is the rice fields, and in the north and east are surrounded by river Ciwulan, which the source of water comes from Mount Cikuray in Garut Regency.\n\nThe distance from the town of Tasikmalaya to Kampung Naga is approximately 30 kilometers, while the distance from the city of Garut is 26 kilometers. To reach Kampung Naga from Garut, Tasikmalaya, people must climb down the ladder in the wall (Sundanese: sengked) to the bank of the river Ciwulan with the slope about 45 degrees with a distance of approximately 500 meters. Then through the paths into Kampung Naga. The settlement is easier to visit than the most ancient Sundanese village in Baduy.\n\nAccording to the data from Neglasari village, the surface soil of Kampung Naga is quite fertile and productive. Kampung Naga covers an area of one of half a hectares, mostly used for housings, yards, ponds, and the rest is used for agriculture rice harvested twice a year.\n\nThe preservation of the village has been supported by national government beginning during the Suharto presidency, and it has been described as part of the \"public face of regulation in Suharto's Indonesia\". The government provided concrete steps which connected the village to the outside world and battery powered radios as gifts for the village; tour guides were government-trained and reiterated the Naga people's desire for: self-sufficiency; the continuation of their traditions; and their desire to be model citizens.",
  "Sulpicia (satirist)\n\nSulpicia was an ancient Roman poet who was active during the reign of the emperor Domitian (r. AD 81\u201396). She is mostly known through two poems of Martial; she is also mentioned by Ausonius, Sidonius Apollinaris, and Fulgentius. A seventy-line hexameter poem and two lines of iambic trimeter attributed to Sulpicia survive; the hexameters are now generally thought to have been a fourth- or fifth-century imitation of Sulpicia. Judging by the ancient references to her and the single surviving couplet of her poetry, Sulpicia wrote love poetry discussing her desire for her husband, and was known for her frank sexuality.\n\nLife\n\nLittle is known of Sulpicia's life. She was married to a man named Calenus, likely a patron of Martial, who is the source of most of what is known about her. Martial mentions her in two poems, and praises her faithfulness. His epigram 10.38 suggests that Sulpicia and Calenus were married for at least 15 years, at which point, judging by ancient Roman marriage norms, Sulpicia would have been at least 30. The poem is usually read as a poem of consolation after Sulpicia's death, though Amy Richlin argues that it might instead have been written about Sulpicia and Calenus having divorced, and Edward Courtney suggests that it is celebrating an anniversary. If it was written as a consolation for Sulpicia's death, she probably died between 95 and 98 AD.\n\nAs Sulpicia is also the name of the only other Roman woman poet about whom any substantial information has survived, Thomas Hubbard suggests that her name was a pseudonym borrowed from the earlier Sulpicia.\n\nPoetry\n\nSulpicia seems to have written poetry that was erotic or satirical. She is the only woman known from antiquity who was associated with a comic genre. Judging by the surviving testimonia on Sulpicia, she openly discussed her sexual desire for her husband; this outspoken centring of female sexual desire is extremely unusual amongst ancient women poets. By contrast with the male love poets of ancient Rome, however, Sulpicia portrays her desire only within the context of her marriage.\n\nTwo lines of iambic trimeter attributed to Sulpicia are quoted by a scholiast on Juvenal. These lines are generally accepted as the only surviving fragment of Sulpicia's poetry. The manuscript with the scholion is now lost, but it was quoted by Giorgio Valla in his 1486 edition of Juvenal. The text quoted by Valla is attributed to \"Sulpicius\", and was first identified as a fragment of Sulpicia by the 16th century scholar Pierre Pithou based on the mention of Calenus. The text transmitted by Valla is corrupt and the meaning continues to be debated, though the lines apparently come from one of the erotic poems about Calenus that are mentioned by Martial.\n\nSulpiciae Conquestio\n\nA seventy-line hexameter poem on the expulsion from Rome of Greek philosophers by Domitian was for a long time attributed to Sulpicia. The poem was preserved in an anthology from the early fifth century. The only manuscript known to have survived antiquity, the Epigrammata Bobiensia, preserved at Bobbio Abbey in northern Italy, is now lost; the modern text of the poem derives from four copies of a transcript made of the manuscript in the late fifth century. The poem, known as the Sulpiciae Conquestio (Sulpicia's Complaint) was first printed in 1498, and its authorship remained unquestioned until the second half of the 19th century. In 1868, J.C.G. Boot argued that the poem was a 15th-century composition; in 1873 Emil Baehrens was the first to suggest it was a work of late antiquity. Modern scholars generally consider that the work was not by Sulpicia, and was composed in the fourth or fifth century AD. The only information about Sulpicia that the Conquestio adds to that transmitted by Martial is the mention of three metres that she wrote in: hendecasyllables, iambic trimeters, and scazons. It is unclear why the poem imitated Sulpicia, as she is otherwise only associated with love poetry, rather than the political satire of the Conquestio.\n\nReception\n\nMartial compares Sulpicia's poetry, along with her conduct, favourably to Sappho. Her poetry seems to have continued to be known and well thought of into the fifth century \u2013 she is mentioned alongside Plato, Cicero, Martial, and Juvenal by Ausonius and Sidonius Apollinaris. She is also mentioned by the mythographer Fulgentius, though it is unclear whether he had read her work or only knew of her through Ausonius. Sulpicia's poetry was well known enough for a scholiast on Juvenal to quote, and for the author of the Conquestio to adopt her identity. During this period, Sulpicia was apparently best known for the sexual nature of her poetry. As all but two lines of her poetry are now lost, it is impossible to judge her writing today.",

  "ZSSK Class 425.95\n\nThe ZSSK Class 425.95, is a class of metre gauge electric articulated trains currently operating on the Tatra Electric Railway (TE\u017d), in the Pre\u0161ov Region of northeastern Slovakia. They are part of the Stadler GTW family of rail vehicles, developed by Stadler Rail.\n\nDue to their boxy shape, and angled cab ends, the members of the class have been nicknamed \"Tetrapaks\".\n\nBackground\n\nThe TE\u017d is a 35 km long line connecting Poprad-Tatry railway station, on the standard gauge Ko\u0161ice\u2013Bohum\u00edn Railway, with a number of ski, tourist, and health resorts in the nearby High Tatras.\n\nOpened in 1908, the line was completely refurbished in the late 1960s, and is now operated by the \u017delezni\u010dn\u00e1 spolo\u010dnos\u0165 Slovensko (Railway Corporation of Slovakia) (ZSSK).\n\nBy the end of the twentieth century, the \u010cSD Class EMU 89.0 multiple units, which had entered service on the TE\u017d as an integral part of the 1960s refurbishment, had reached the end of their working lives.\n\nThe fifteen members of the ZSSK Class 425.95 were gradually introduced from 2000 to replace them, and now operate all TE\u017d services.\n\nTechnical details\n\nThe tender for the supply of 14 units was won by a consortium, GTW High Tatras, which had been formed by the companies \u017dOS Vr\u00fatky, Stadler Rail and Daimler-Chrysler Rail Systems. The design of the class was based upon that of the Stadler GTW 2/6. The overall assembly of the class members was carried out by \u017dOS Vr\u00fatky.\n\nEach unit is made up of three sections. The middle section, with a carbody made of steel, is fitted with electrical equipment and traction motors driving a twin axle bogie. Each of the lightweight outer sections, made of aluminium, has a passenger compartment, a driver's workstation, and an unpowered twin axle bogie. The three sections are connected together by steel-rubber joints.\n\nThe roof of the middle section is equipped with an electrically controlled pantograph to collect DC current. Each drive axle in the middle bogie is powered by a three-phase asynchronous motor, fed by an inverter changing the DC power supply to AC.\n\nAll units have four braking systems - electro-operating regenerative brakes and an electromagnetic brake on the drive chassis and an electro-mechanical brake and a spring parking brake on all axles. Air suspension is used to minimize the transmission of vibration from the chassis to the passenger compartment.\n\nEach outer section is fitted with electrically driven double-leaf doors, operated by on-demand controls. In the boarding area inside the doors, there are outboard folding seats, 10 holders for skis or bicycles, and handles for standing passengers.\n\nThe portions of the outer sections between the boarding areas and the driver's compartments have an elevated floor, accessible from the boarding areas by stairs. The portions between the boarding areas and the middle section have low floors. The upholstered passenger seats in all parts of the passenger compartments are arranged in a 2 + 2 configuration with a middle aisle. On each side of these compartments are large windows with tinted double glazing.\n\nThe driver's workstations are separated from the passenger compartments by partly glazed partitions and all glass doors.\n\nIn normal use, the passenger compartments are ventilated by microprocessor controlled ceiling ducts. Emergency ventilation can be achieved by tilting open the upper parts of some of the side windows. Heating elements are fitted to the sidewalls. Interior lighting is provided by fluorescent lamps, and the passenger compartments also have visual information systems, with multilingual acoustic stop announcements. All members of the class have been liveried since new in a red, white and grey design.\n\nService history\n\nThe first member of the class arrived at Poprad in mid-October 2000, after being displayed at the International Engineering Fair in Brno. On 19 October 2000, it made its first trip on the TE\u017d, an unpowered run to Star\u00fd Smokovec behind a Class EMU 89.0. Between November 2000 and March 2001, the class leader, numbered 425.951, underwent testing on the network. It then operated trial runs with passengers.\n\nThe testing process revealed certain incompatibilities between modern vehicles and the TE\u017d's then outdated track and power systems. The latter therefore required some conversion work, including reprofiling of the lines in some sections, reconstruction of the platforms across the network, and also adjustments to the power system to enable it to benefit from the new vehicles' regenerative brakes. Eventually the class leader completed the tests and entered regular service.\n\nIn 2001-2002, a total of 13 further units and one spare middle section were delivered. They gradually replaced the Class EMU 89.0 units, which were progressively retired. However, the total capacity of the new units proved to be somewhat inadequate, given that only 14 units had replaced 18 predecessors. In 2006, therefore, some of the Class EMU 89.0 units were returned to service to supplement the new units. The same year, two additional class 425.95 outer sections were acquired, and combined with the spare section to make up a fifteenth unit.\n\nThe class 425.95s are also capable of multiple unit operation in pairs.\n\nThe individual units are numbered as 425 951 to 425.965.",

  "Miroslav Zajonc\n\nMiroslav (\"Miro\") Zajonc or Zayonc (born June 10, 1960) is a Slovak-born luger who competed for Czechoslovakia, Canada and the United States. Competing for Canada, he won the gold medal in the men's singles event at the 1983 FIL World Luge Championships in Lake Placid, New York in four record breaking runs. He represented the United States at the 1988 Winter Olympics.\n\nPersonal life\n\nZajonc was born on June 10, 1960, in Spi\u0161sk\u00e1 Star\u00e1 Ves, Czechoslovakia. He grew up in the Tatra mountains in the town of Stary Smokovec in Slovakia. In 1995, he changed the spelling of his surname to Zayonc to aid with pronunciation. He became a U.S. citizen in 1996.\n\nAs a competitor\n\nZajonc started training in luge in 1971 and competed for Czechoslovakia until his defection to the United States in 1981. He was unable to compete for the U.S. until 1985 due to the U.S. luge citizenship qualification policy.\n\nZajonc was allowed to compete for Canada and he won the World Championships in 1983. He defeated world champion Sergey Danilin (Soviet Union), Olympic champion Paul Hildgartner (Italy), and 1980 Olympic champion Bernhard Glass (Germany). Although Zajonc lacked a large support staff like the dominant German, Italian, and Soviet teams, the Italian luger Hansj\u00f6rg Raffl gave him one of his new speed suits just before the competition to help him be competitive with the best teams. His victory created problems for the Soviet coaching staff as he defeated Danilin on a Soviet-built sled purchased from them just months prior to the race.\n\nDespite sliding his best at the time Zajonc was unable to compete at the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo, due to not having US citizenship. After 1985, he represented the United States and was named in the U.S. team to the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary. He qualified despite breaking his right foot in a training accident five weeks prior to the Olympics. Zajonc suffered an open fracture and was missing part of his heal bone after hitting his foot at 65 mph 2\u00d76 wall extension that was left square with the bottom of his foot. His injury prevented him from competing in singles and he would finish 11th in the men's doubles event for the US team, sliding with a special cast on his right foot. He used crutches to get to the start. The East German team requested to inspect Zayonc's injury, thinking he might be faking it to gain a competitive advantage using the pointed cast. He retired from competition in 1988.\n\nAs a coach\n\nZajonc joined the USA luge team's coaching staff in 1990. He served as head coach of the junior national team from 1991-2011. His athletes won 15 World Championship titles and many overall World Cup victories. He also coached the US Olympic luge teams in 1992, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, 2010 and 2014, winning five Olympic medals. In September 2012, Zayonc was named U.S. senior national head coach heading for Sochi. At the Olympics, Erin Hamlin won a bronze medal, the first-ever US Olympic medal in singles luge.\n\nIn May 2017, Zajonc stepped down as head coach, due to Parkinson's disease. USA Luge CEO Jim Leahy stated that Zayonc would remain active in the organization.",
  "The Very Best of Slim Dusty\n\nThe Very Best of Slim Dusty is a greatest hits album by Australian country recording artist Slim Dusty.

  "Xerox art\n\nXerox art (sometimes, more generically, called copy art, electrostatic art, scanography or xerography) is an art form that began in the 1960s. Prints are created by putting objects on the glass, or platen, of a copying machine and by pressing \"start\" to produce an image. If the object is not flat, or the cover does not totally cover the object, or the object is moved, the resulting image is distorted in some way. The curvature of the object, the amount of light that reaches the image surface, and the distance of the cover from the glass, all affect the final image. Often, with proper manipulation, rather ghostly images can be made. Basic techniques include: Direct Imaging, the copying of items placed on the platen (normal copy); Still Life Collage, a variation of direct imaging with items placed on the platen in a collage format focused on what is in the foreground/background; Overprinting, the technique of constructing layers of information, one over the previous, by printing onto the same sheet of paper more than once; Copy Overlay, a technique of working with or interfering in the color separation mechanism of a color copier; Colorizing, vary color density and hue by adjusting the exposure and color balance controls; Degeneration is a copy of a copy degrading the image as successive copies are made; Copy Motion, the creation of effects by moving an item or image on the platen during the scanning process. Each machine also creates different effects.\n\nAccessible art\n\nXerox art appeared shortly after the first Xerox copying machines were made. It is often used in collage, mail art and book art. Publishing collaborative mail art in small editions of Xerox art and mailable book art was the purpose of International Society of Copier Artists (I.S.C.A.) founded by Louise Odes Neaderland.\n\nThroughout the history of copy art San Francisco and Rochester are mentioned frequently. Rochester was known as the Imaging Capital of the World with Eastman Kodak and Xerox, while many artists with innovative ideas created cutting edge works in San Francisco. Alongside the computer boom a copy art explosion was taking place. Copy shops were springing up all over San Francisco, and access to copiers made it possible to create inexpensive art of unique imagery. Multiple prints of assemblage and collage meant artists could share work more freely. Print on demand meant making books and magazines at the corner copy shop without censorship and with only a small outlay of funds. Comic book artists could quickly use parts of their work over and over.\n\nEarly history 1960s\u20131970s\n\nThe first artists recognized to make copy art are Charles Arnold, Jr., and Wallace Berman. Charles Arnold, Jr., an instructor at Rochester Institute of Technology, made the first photocopies with artistic intent in 1961 using a large Xerox camera on an experimental basis. Berman, called the \"father\" of assemblage art, would use a Verifax photocopy machine (Kodak) to make copies of the images, which he would often juxtapose in a grid format. Berman was influenced by his San Francisco Beat circle and by Surrealism, Dada, and the Kabbalah. Sonia Landy Sheridan began teaching the first course in the use of copiers at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1970.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, Esta Nesbitt was one of the earliest artists experimenting with xerox art. She invent three xerography techniques, named transcapsa, photo-transcapsa, and chromacapsa. Nesbitt worked closely with Anibal Ambert and Merle English at Xerox Corporation, and the company sponsored her art research from 1970 until 1972.\n\nSeth Siegelaub and Jack Wendler made Untitled (Xerox Book) with artists Carl Andre, Robert Barry, Douglas Huebler, Joseph Kosuth, Sol LeWitt, Robert Morris, and Lawrence Weiner in 1968.\n\nCopy artists' dependence upon the same machines does not mean that they share a common style or aesthetic. Artists as various as Ian Burn (a conceptual/process artist who made another Xerox Book in 1968), Laurie Rae Chamberlain (a punk-inspired colour Xeroxer exhibiting in the mid 1970s) and Helen Chadwick (a feminist artist using her own body as subject matter in the 1980s) have employed photocopiers for very different purposes.\n\nOther artists who have made significant use of the machines include: Carol Key, Sarah Willis, Joseph D. Harris, Tyler Moore, the Copyart Collective of Camden, as well as:\n\nin continental Europe\n\nin the UK\n\nin Brazil\n\nin Canada\n\nin the US\n\nIn the mid-1970s Pati Hill did art experiments with an IBM copier. Hill's resulting xerox artwork was exhibited at Centre Pompidou, Paris, the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, and the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, among other venues in Europe and the US.\n\nRecognition of the art form\n\nSan Francisco had an active Xerox arts scene that started in 1976 at the LaMamelle gallery with the All Xerox exhibit and in 1980 the International Copy Art Exhibition, curated and organized by Ginny Lloyd, was also held at LaMamelle gallery. The exhibition traveled to San Jose, California, and Japan. Lloyd also made the first copy art billboard (the first of three) with a grant from Eyes and Ears Foundation.\n\nA gallery named Studio 718 moved into the Beat poet area of San Francisco's North Beach neighborhood. It shared space in part with Postcard Palace, where several copy artists sold postcard editions; the space also housed a Xerox 6500. At around the same time color copy calendars produced in multiple editions made by Barbara Cushman sold at her store and gallery, A Fine Hand.\n\nIn the 1980, Marilyn McCray curated the Electroworks Exhibit held at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum in New York and International Museum of Photography at George Eastman House. On view at the Cooper Hewitt were more than 250 examples of prints, limited-edition books, graphics, animation, textiles, and 3-D pieces produced by artists and designers.\n\nGaleria Motivation of Montreal, Canada, held an exhibit of copy art in 1981. PostMachina, an exhibit in Bologna, Italy, held in 1984, featured copy art works.\n\nIn May 1987, artist and curator George Muhleck wrote in Stuttgart about the international exhibition \"Medium: Photocopie\" that it inquired into \"new artistic ways of handling photocopy.\" The book which accompanied the exhibition was sponsored mainly by the Goethe Institut of Montreal, with additional support from the Ministere des Affaires Culturelles du Quebec.\n\nThe complete collection I.S.C.A. Quarterlies is housed at the Jaffe Book Arts Collection of the Special Collections of the Wimberly Library at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, Florida. The collection began in 1989 with several volumes donated by the Bienes Museum of the Modern Book, in Fort Lauderdale, FL. The Jaffe hosted an exhibition in 2010 of copy art by Ginny Lloyd, showcasing her works and copy art collection. She lectures and teaches workshops at the Jaffe on copy art history and techniques. She previously taught the workshop in 1981 at Academie Aki, Other Books and So Archive, and Jan Van Eyck Academie in The Netherlands; Image Resource Center in Cleveland and University of California - Berkeley.\n\nIn 2017\u20132018, the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York presented Experiments in Electrostatics: Photocopy Art from the Whitney\u2019s Collection, 1966\u20131986, organized by curatorial fellow Michelle Donnelly.\n\nCurrent artwork\n\nCopiers add to the arts, as can be seen by surrealist Jan Hathaway's combining color xerography with other media, Carol Heifetz Neiman's layering prismacolor pencil through successive runs of a color photocopy process (1988-1990), or R.L. Gibson's use of large scale xerography such as in Psychomachia (2010).\n\nIn 1991, independent filmmaker Chel White completed a 4-minute animated film titled \"Choreography for Copy Machine (Photocopy Cha Cha)\". All of the film's images were created solely by using the unique photographic capabilities of a Sharp mono-colour photocopier to generate sequential pictures of hands, faces, and other body parts. Layered colors were created by shooting the animation through photographic gels. The film achieves a dream-like aesthetic with elements of the sensual and the absurd. The Berlin International Film Festival describes it as \"a swinging essay about physiognomy in the age of photo-mechanical reproduction. The Austin Film Society dubs it, \"Doubtlessly the best copy machine art with delightfully rhythmic sequences of images, all to a cha-cha-cha beat.\" The film screened in a special program at the 2001 Sundance Film Festival, and was awarded Best Animated Short Film at the 1992 Ann Arbor Film Festival\n\nManufacturers of the machines are an obvious source of funding for artistic experimentation with copiers and such companies as Rank, Xerox, Canon and Selex have been willing to lend machines, sponsor shows and pay for artists-in-residence programs.",
  "Drisht\n\nDrisht is a village, former bishopric and Latin titular see with an Ancient and notable medieval history (Latin Drivastum, Italian Drivasto) in Albania, 6 km from Mes Bridge (Albanian: Ura e Mesit). It is located in the former municipality Postrib\u00eb in the Shkod\u00ebr County. At the 2015 local government reform it became part of the municipality Shkod\u00ebr. The ruined 13th Century Drisht Castle is on a hilltop 300m above sea level. The ruins of the castle itself contains the remains of 11 houses, and below the ruins of the castle, and above the modern village of Drisht are further archeological remains of late-Roman and medieval Drivastum.\n\nName\n\nThe name of the settlement was recorded in Latin as Drivastum. Albanian Drisht derives from Drivastum through Albanian phonetic changes, however it has been noted that the accentual pattern found in Dr\u00edsht < Dr\u00edvastum presupposes an Adriatic \"Illyrian\" intermediary.\n\nHistory\n\nThe settlement of Drivastum is known to have existed before the tenth century AD. The Diocese of Drivastum became a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Antivari in 1089, after it was transferred from the Archdiocese of Ragusa.\n\nIn 1081\u20141116 Drivastum belonged to the kingdom of Duklja. In 1183, Serbian Stefan Nemanja conquered Drivast and its surroundings.\n\nIn 1241, the city was plundered by the Mongols under Subutai, as they were advancing east across Zeta, while heading home. Scholars estimate that Drivast was taken by the Bal\u0161i\u0107i ca. spring of 1362. However, it is known that by 1363, they had captured Drivast and nearby Scutari.\n\nIn 1393, \u0110ura\u0111 II Bal\u0161i\u0107, having negotiated his freedom from Ottoman captivity, submitted to the Great Sultan's suzerainty and surrendered Drivast, Sveti Sr\u0111 and Scutari. However, \u0110ura\u0111 soon ended his vassalage to the Ottomans and reconquered the cities he had surrendered mere months before. In 1395, knowing he could not outlast an Ottoman attack, he handed these cities, including Drivast, to dogal Venice in exchange for 1,000 ducats yearly.\n\nIn 1399, the townspeople in Drivasto (the city's new Italian name) and Scutari started a revolt against Venice, angered at the high taxes they were paying. The revolt lasted for three years, when Venetian troops managed to control the situation. However, the areas surrounding Drivast and Scutari no longer recognized Venetian authority.\n\nAngered by Venice's policy on his former lands and its trade monopoly policy that caused an economic stagnation in his ports, \u0110ura\u0111 II sent troops to his former lands, including Drivast, breaking his peace treaty with Venice. \u0110ura\u0111's actions led to Venice believing that he had a major role in the uprising's initiation. Scholars are unsure whether this accusation is accurate. The Turks also decided to send raiding parties to these rebellious lands.\n\nIn 1423 \u0110ura\u0111 Brankovi\u0107 conquered Drivast and annexed it to Serbian Despotate. Supported by Ottomans, Goj\u010din Crnojevi\u0107 and Little Tanush Dukagjin, Maramonte plundered region around Scutari and Ulcinj and attacked Drivast in 1429, but failed to capture it.\n\nIn August 1442, Venice took Drivast from Serbian Despot \u0110ura\u0111 Brankovi\u0107. Native citizens of Drivast were hostile toward advances of Albanians and Serbs so they accepted Venetian suzerainty only under condition that Venice wouldn't employ Albanian pronoiers and to return to the city land Serbian despot gave to Serbs.\n\nIn 1447, Skanderbeg demanded from the Venetians to give control over Drivast to him, along with the lands which earlier belonged to Lek\u00eb Zakarija. However, the Venetians refused to accept his demands and Skanderbeg started the war against Venice.\n\nIn March 1451 Lek\u00eb Dukagjini and Bo\u017eidar Dushmani planned to attack Venetian controlled Drivast. Their plot was discovered and Bo\u017eidar was forced to exile.\n\nIn September 1478, Drivast was captured by the Ottomans.\n\nEcclesiastical History\n\nThe bishopric was founded around 400 AD, as a suffragan of its Late Roman province Dalmatia Superior's capital Doclea's Metropolitan bishop. Drivastum became a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Antivari in 1089, after it was transferred from the Archdiocese of Ragusa. The townspeople of Drivast murdered one of their bishops in the thirteenth century.\n\n(all Roman Rite; incomplete : first centuries unavailable)\n\nThe residential see was suppressed in 1650, its territory being merged into the Diocese of Shkodr\u00eb (in Albania).\n\nTitular see\n\nIn 1933 the diocese was nominally restored as Latin Titular bishopric of Drivastum (Drivasto in Curiate Italian).\n\nIt has had the following incumbents, of the fitting episcopal (lowest) rank with two archiepiscopal (intermediary) exceptions :\n\nModern Drisht\n\nThe population of modern Drisht is predominantly Muslim and Albanian speaking. Drisht is accessible by a 4x4 or by walking.",
  "Town hall of Bordighera\n\nThe Town hall of Bordighera is located at 32 Via XX Settembre in Bordighera, Liguria.\n\nHistory\n\nThe current town hall was built to a design by the French architect Charles Garnier. Garnier, who had left Paris because of Paris Commune (1871), was looking for a land in Bordighera to build his future house. In 1871 he proposed the municipality to buy the land where only school of the city stayed. The offer of 6,000 pounds was very generous, it would have allowed the construction of a new school for which Garnier provided the plans.\n\nThe project included a classical building that integrates well with the old town of Bordighera that lies behind. The new schools foresaw not only a new section for boys replacing the previous one, but also a girls' section and one for small children. The project is to be considered truly innovative for its time and the municipality accepted the proposal. During the works, which were not followed by Garnier, there were numerous technical problems and delays in deliveries. It was only in 1878 that part of the building was finally terminated.\n\nMeanwhile, the population grew and the city decided to build a new school that was opened later in 1886. With the transfer of the school, the municipality decided to use the building as its headquarters. The facade was carved with the coat of arms of the city, a rampant lion that leans against a Pine seafarer. Inside the town hall you can admire numerous paintings from various artists who stayed in Bordighera, including: Pompeo Mariani, Giuseppe Ferdinando Piana, Giuseppe Balbo, Friederich von Kleudgen, etc.\n\nThe gardens\n\nThe true gardens of the town hall are between the building designed by Charles Garnier and the Cape Esplanade. These gardens, although of small size, can boast two great Ficus macrophylla centenarians and many varieties of exotic plants (agaves, palm trees, cactus, etc.) which can also be seen in many Bordighera gardens. On 17 January 1954, the city placed a bust in honour of Ludwig Winter, its illustrious adopted citizen, as an honour to the man who had done so much to bring prestige to the city and to the Riviera. This is sometimes confusing. Some mistakenly call these gardens also \"Winter Gardens\", but the real Winter Gardens are at 6 Ludovico Winter Street in Bordighera.\n\nAt the foot of the old town hall of Bordighera, there is a large wooden area that is called in various ways: the gardens of the Cape or, more commonly, Cape Pineta. The gardens are vast, and full of very old trees such as pines, olive trees, palm trees and a variety of other species, but very old specimens of Araucaria heterophylla stand out. In the pine forest there is also a bust in honour of the painter Mos\u00e8 Bianchi, who often came to Bordighera to spend time with his grandson Pompeo Mariani. Also in the Cape Pineta, but a bit lower, there is a monument in honour of Charles Garnier.\n\nOn May 15, 2015, the renovation of the Marabutto was terminated. It is an ancient powder keg that is currently in the Cape Pineta. The name is due to the shape of the small building that recalls the graves of Muslim holy men (a cube topped by a dome), whose name is precisely marabutto. Near the Marabutto, you can see three old cannons so much loved by the locals that they were given names: Butafoegu, Tiralogni et Cacastrasse.\n\nTrivia\n\nWhen the city had to choose its coat of arms, a dispute broke out with the neighbouring city of Sanremo. Bordighera, which was nicknamed \"Queen of the Palms\", wanted to see represented the palm on his coat of arms, but the bigger rival city had already a similar one, so Bordighera had to settle for a pine.\n\nBehind the municipal building is one of four Ficus Magnolioides recognised by the State Forestry. The monumental tree has an estimated age of 100 years, with a height of 18 meters and a diameter of the stem of 1040 cm.",

  "Daridorexant\n\nDaridorexant, sold under the brand name Quviviq, is an orexin antagonist medication which is used for the treatment of insomnia. Daridorexant is taken by mouth.\n\nSide effects of daridorexant include headache, somnolence, and fatigue. The medication is a dual orexin receptor antagonist (DORA). It acts as a selective dual antagonist of the orexin receptors OX1 and OX2. Daridorexant has a relatively short elimination half-life of 8hours and a time to peak of about 1 to 2hours. It is not a benzodiazepine or Z-drug and does not interact with GABA receptors, instead having a distinct mechanism of action.\n\nDaridorexant was approved for medical use in the United States in January 2022 and became available in May 2022. It was approved in the European Union in April 2022, and is the first orexin receptor antagonist to become available in European Union. The medication is a schedule IV controlled substance in the United States and may have a modest potential for misuse.\n\nMedical uses\n\nDaridorexant is indicated for the treatment of adults with insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance. The medication has been found to significantly improve latency to persistent sleep (LPS), wake after sleep onset (WASO), and subjective total sleep time (TST) in regulatory clinical trials. At doses of 25 to 50mg and in terms of treatment\u2013placebo difference, it reduces LPS by 6 to 12minutes, reduces WASO by 10 to 23minutes, and increases subjective TST by 10 to 22minutes. Daridorexant has also been found to improve daytime functioning at a dose of 50mg but not at 25mg. It is the first insomnia medication to have been evaluated and shown effectiveness in improving not only nighttime symptoms but also daytime functioning.\n\nNetwork meta-analyses have assessed the sleep-promoting effects of orexin receptor antagonists and have compared them between one another as well as to other sleep aids including benzodiazepines, Z-drugs, antihistamines, sedative antidepressants (e.g., trazodone, doxepin, amitriptyline, mirtazapine), and melatonin receptor agonists. A major systematic review and network meta-analysis of insomnia medications published in 2022 found that daridorexant had an effect size (standardized mean difference (SMD)) against placebo for treatment of insomnia at 4weeks of 0.23 (95% CI \u20130.01 to 0.48). This was similar to but numerically lower than the effect sizes at 4weeks for suvorexant (SMD 0.31, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.62) and lemborexant (SMD 0.36, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.63). Benzodiazepines and Z-drugs generally showed larger effect sizes than orexin receptor antagonists (e.g., SMDs of 0.45 to 0.83). The review concluded on the basis of daridorexant's small effect size that it did not show an overall material benefit in the treatment of insomnia. Conversely, it concluded that lemborexant\u2014as well as the Z-drug eszopiclone\u2014had the best profiles overall in terms of efficacy, tolerability, and acceptability among all of the assessed insomnia medications.\n\nOrexin receptor antagonists are not used as first-line treatments for insomnia due to their costs and concerns about possible misuse liability.\n\nAvailable forms\n\nDaridorexant is available in the form of 25 and 50mg oral tablets. It is provided as the salt daridorexant hydrochloride, with each tablet containing 27 or 54mg of this substance (equivalent to 25 or 50mg daridorexant).\n\nContraindications\n\nDaridorexant is contraindicated in people with narcolepsy. It is not recommended in people with severe hepatic impairment, whereas a lower maximum dose is recommended in people with moderate hepatic impairment. Concomitant use of daridorexant with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and moderate to strong CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended and should be avoided due to unfavorable modification of daridorexant exposure.\n\nSide effects\n\nSide effects of daridorexant include headache (6% at 25mg vs. 7% at 50mg vs. 5% for placebo), somnolence or fatigue (includes somnolence, sedation, fatigue, hypersomnia, and lethargy) (6% at 25mg vs. 5% at 50mg vs. 4% for placebo), dizziness (2% at 25mg vs. 3% at 50mg vs. 2% for placebo), and nausea (0% at 25mg vs. 3% at 50mg vs. 2% for placebo). No residual effects have been found after administration of 25mg daridorexant in the evening to either young or elderly individuals. However, daridorexant may cause next-morning driving impairment at the start of treatment or in some individuals. Orexin receptor antagonists like daridorexant may have less or no propensity for causing tolerance compared to other sedatives and hypnotics based on animal studies. Daridorexant did not produce signs of withdrawal or dependence upon discontinuation in animal studies and clinical trials, and orexin receptor antagonists are not associated with rebound insomnia. Loss of sleep-promoting effectiveness occurs rapidly upon discontinuation of daridorexant. Preclinical research has suggested that orexin antagonists may reduce appetite, but daridorexant and other orexin antagonists have not been associated with weight loss in rigorous clinical trials.\n\nOrexin receptor antagonists can affect the reward system and produce drug-liking responses in humans. Daridorexant at a dose of 50mg (the maximum recommended dose) showed significantly greater drug liking than placebo but significantly less drug liking than zolpidem (30mg) and suvorexant (150mg) in recreational sedative drug users. At higher doses of 100 and 150mg (greater than the recommended maximum dose), drug liking with daridorexant was similar to that with zolpidem (30mg) and suvorexant (150mg). In other studies, suvorexant showed similar drug liking compared to zolpidem but lower misuse potential on other measures (e.g., overall rate of misuse potential adverse events of 58% for zolpidem and 31% for suvorexant in recreational drug users). No reports indicative of misuse liability were observed in large clinical trials with daridorexant, although these studies excluded participants with history of drug or alcohol misuse.\n\nOverdose\n\nThere is limited clinical experience with overdose of daridorexant. Overdose of the medication at a dose of up to four times the maximum recommended dose may result in adverse effects including somnolence, muscle weakness, catalepsy-like symptoms, sleep paralysis, attention disturbances, fatigue, headache, and constipation. There is no specific antidote to overdose of daridorexant.\n\nInteractions\n\nCYP3A4 inhibitors like ranitidine and diltiazem and CYP3A4 inducers like efavirenz can increase and decrease exposure to daridorexant, respectively. Concomitant use of daridorexant with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or moderate or strong CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided, while it is recommended that the maximum dose of daridorexant be limited with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors. Gastric pH modifiers like famotidine can decrease peak levels of daridorexant without affecting total exposure. Alcohol and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like citalopram have not shown significant pharmacokinetic interactions with daridorexant. Coadministration of daridorexant with other sedatives like benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, and alcohol may increase the risk of central nervous system depression and daytime impairment. Daridorexant has not been found to significantly influence the pharmacokinetics of other drugs including midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate), rosuvastatin (BCRP substrate), and the SSRI citalopram.\n\nPharmacodynamics\n\nDaridorexant acts as a selective dual antagonist of the orexin (hypocretin) receptors OX1 and OX2. The affinities (Ki) of daridorexant for the orexin receptors are 0.47nM for the OX1 receptor and 0.93nM for the OX2 receptor. Its Kb values for the human orexin receptors have been reported to be 0.5nM for the OX1 receptor and 0.8nM for the OX2 receptor. Hence, daridorexant is approximately equipotent in its antagonism of the orexin receptors. Daridorexant is selective for the orexin receptors over many other targets. In contrast to certain other sedatives and hypnotics, daridorexant is not a benzodiazepine or Z-drug and does not interact with GABA receptors.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nThe endogenous orexin neuropeptides, orexin A and orexin B, are involved in the regulation of sleep\u2013wake cycles and act to promote wakefulness. Deficiency of orexin signaling is thought to be the primary cause of the sleep disorder narcolepsy. Disturbances in orexin signaling may also be involved in insomnia. Research suggests that orexin signaling may change with",

  "Fanjingshan\n\nThe Fanjingshan or Mount Fanjing, located in Tongren, Guizhou province, is the highest peak of the Wuling Mountains in southeastern China, at an elevation of 2,570 m. The Fanjingshan National Nature Reserve was established in 1978 and designated a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1986. Fanjingshan is a sacred mountain in Chinese Buddhism, considered to be the bodhima\u1e47\u1e0da of the Maitreya Buddha. It became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2018.\n\nName\n\nThe mountain's name \"Fanjing\" is an abbreviation of Fantian Jingtu (\u68b5\u5929\u51c0\u571f), or \"Brahma's Pure Land\". Fantian is the Chinese name for the Buddhist heavenly king Brahm\u0101, and Jingtu is Chinese for \"pure land\", the focus of Pure Land Buddhism.\n\nLocation and environment\n\nFanjingshan is located in Tongren, Guizhou Province in southeastern China. It is the highest peak of the Wuling Mountains. The elevation of its terrain ranges from 480 to(-) above sea level.\n\nThe Fanjingshan National Nature Reserve was established in 1978 and designated a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1986. The reserve covers a total area of 567 km2 and is a conservation area for primitive vegetation of the mid sub-tropic alpine region of eastern China. The mountain was designated a World Heritage Site in July 2018.\n\nFanjingshan's relative isolation has ensured a high degree of biodiversity. Endemic species such as the rare Guizhou golden monkey (Rhinopithecus brelichi) and the Fanjingshan fir (Abies fanjingshanensis) occur only in a small region centering on Fanjingshan. Several endangered species, including the Chinese giant salamander, forest musk deer, and Reeve's pheasant are also found in Fanjingshan. It is also home to the largest and most contiguous subtropical primeval beech forest.\n\nBuddhism\n\nFanjingshan is considered a sacred mountain of Chinese Buddhism, ranking just below the Four Sacred Mountains of Buddhism. It is considered the bodhima\u1e47\u1e0da (or daochang)\u2014a spot in which one reached enlightenment\u2014of the Maitreya Buddha. The influence of Buddhism reached Fanjingshan by the Tang dynasty at the latest, especially after Hou Hongren (\u4faf\u5f18\u4ec1) constructed the Zangke Road (\u7242\u7241\u9053) in 639 AD, which facilitated transport in the mountainous region, and local gazettes record the construction of several temples in the area. More temples were built during the ensuing Song and Yuan dynasties.\n\nBuddhism greatly prospered during the Ming and Qing dynasties, when the cult of Tianguan Maitreya (\u5929\u51a0\u5f25\u52d2) became dominant in Fanjingshan. The Bozhou rebellion in the late 16th century caused great damages to Fanjingshan's temples. After suppressing the rebellion, the Wanli Emperor ordered the monk Miaoxuan (\u5999\u7384) to rebuild the Golden Peak and the Cheng'en Temple (\u627f\u6069\u5bfa). Many other temples were constructed in the area, ushering in the golden era for Buddhism in Fanjingshan. Most temples during the Ming and Qing dynasties belonged to the Pure Land and the Linji sects of Buddhism.\n\nIn the turmoil that toppled the Qing dynasty, many temples were destroyed by marauding armies and bandits, and few monks remained in the Republic of China era. After further destructions during the Cultural Revolution, Buddhism has enjoyed a renaissance since the 1980s. Many old temples have been rebuilt and new ones constructed, including the Cheng'en Temple, Huguo Chan Temple (\u62a4\u56fd\u7985\u5bfa), Great Golden Buddha Temple (\u5927\u91d1\u4f5b\u5bfa), and Longquan Temple (\u9f99\u6cc9\u5bfa).\n\nIn 2010, the Fanjingshan Buddhist Cultural Park was opened, with a Golden Hall that houses a 5 m statue of the Maitreya Buddha made with 250 kg of gold and thousands of gems. It is said to be the largest gold Maitreya statue in the world.\n\nRecognition\n\nAsteroid 215021 Fanjingshan, discovered by astronomers of the PMO NEO Survey Program in 2005, was named after the World Heritage Site. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 8 November 2019 (M.P.C. 118221).",

  "Teraa Surroor\n\nTeraa Surroor is a 2016 Indian Hindi-language thriller film directed by Shawn Arranha and produced by Vipin Reshammiya and Sonia Kapoor. It is sequel to 2007 film Aap Kaa Surroor. The film was a joint production of T-Series and HR Musik Limited. The film stars Himesh Reshammiya and Farah Karimae in the lead roles. Naseeruddin Shah, Shekhar Kapur, Kabir Bedi, and Monica Dogra play the supporting roles. Teraa Surroor was released on 11 March 2016 in over 1000 cinemas all over India. The basic plot of the movie was based on the 2010 Hollywood film The Next Three Days which itself was a remake of 2008 French movie Anything for Her.\n\nPlot\n\nThe film begins with the murder of two Indian origin men in Ireland being killed by a masked man. The story then shifts to Tara Wadia, who is a singer and the girlfriend of a businessman-cum-gangster Raghu and lives with her mother. Raghu, it is revealed, is much in the eyes of the law.\n\nOne day, Raghu confesses to Tara that he had spent a night with a prostitute unintentionally. Disappointed, Tara breaks up with him and decides to leave for Ireland, despite her mother trying to convince her of Raghu's goodwill. However, the moment she lands in Dublin, she gets detained after being caught with drugs. Tara calls Raghu for help. Now he must help her and find Anirudh Brahman, the stranger who befriended Tara on Facebook and invited her to Ireland.\n\nRaghu hires a lawyer, Elle Jordan, to rescue Tara and tries to get her bailed out, but the plea is rejected by the judiciary. Fearing a supposedly insurmountable life sentence, Raghu decides to help Tara, during which time, it is revealed that in childhood, he used to work for a gangster, Aurangzeb, who was badly wanted by the law, simply because Aurangzeb had held his mother a slave and she was in need of an operation, for which Raghu wanted money. A man named Anthony, instead, promised to give money for his mother's operation, and Raghu was trained in using a pistol to shoot Aurangzeb. When he proceeded with the task, he initially hesitated to shoot the gangster, but when Aurangzeb insulted his mother, Raghu shot him multiple times without a second thought.\n\nRaghu consults with Robin Dharamraj Santino, an infamous convict who has escaped 14 times from prison. Robin says that he would charge him 20 mins each to help him, and Raghu agrees. Robin briefs him all plans and procedures and warns him that he must get Tara out of jail just within 20 minutes before the entire city would lock down by an automatic system. Succeeding in helping Tara escape, Raghu stays back for fighting the cops to buy her time.\n\nAfter a successful escape, Raghu reconciles with Tara after revealing to her that his act of sleeping with the prostitute was actually part of a plan, and that he is actually an undercover assassin who has previously killed many criminals on behalf of Commissioner Afzal A. Khan. Seconds later, he is informed of Anirudh Brahman's location, and upon reaching there, is shocked to find Haider, Tara's close friend and associate, who confesses that he wanted to trap Raghu out of revenge for having killed Aurangzeb, who, it turns out, was his father.

  "Monkey Trouble\n\nMonkey Trouble is a 1994 American comedy drama film directed by Franco Amurri and starring Thora Birch and Harvey Keitel.\n\nPlot\n\nIn Los Angeles, middle school student Eva Gregory (Thora Birch) longs for a pet dog but faces objections from her family members: her mother Amy (Mimi Rogers) believes she isn't responsible enough and her stepfather Tom (Christopher McDonald), a police lieutenant, is allergic to fur. She also can't keep a pet at her biological father, Peter's house due to his job being a pilot and often traveling. Tom's daughter Tessa (Alison Elliott) occasionally babysits Eva and her toddler brother Jack (Adrian and Julian Johnson).\n\nA gypsy kleptomaniac vagabond Azro (Harvey Keitel), whose wife and son Mark (Adam LaVorgna) recently left him, lives off the grid with his intelligent Capuchin monkey Fingers (Finster). Working as a hurdy gurdy-playing busker at Venice Beach, Azro uses Fingers' cuteness as a way to lure in tourists and pickpocket them. A pair of Italian mafia members named Drake (Robert Miranda) and Charlie (Victor Argo) show up to Azro's act. They deduce Azro's scheme and proposition him with bigger & better opportunities. They ask him to join their crime syndicate, with Fingers using his pickpocket skills to burglarize homes of socialites. The men want to do a test run to see how Fingers will act and they drive to a random residence which just happens to be Eva's home. Fingers successfully steals various expensive items and Azro joins the crime group. Angered by memories of his abandonment, Azro often blames Fingers for his wife and son leaving, which leads Fingers to run away from home.\n\nThe next day as Eva is walking home from school, Fingers drops from a tree and latches himself onto Eva. She instantly becomes connected to him, and names him \"Dodger\", as he likes Eva's Dodgers baseball hat. Eva keeps the monkey a secret and hides him in her bedroom. She becomes more responsible with her chores and helps take care of her infant brother Jack, to whom she reveals Dodger. She researches information on his breed. When Eva has to leave for school, she leaves him in the care of a pet store businesswoman named Annie (Jo Champa). Eva fibs that the monkey is a present for her mother. Meanwhile, Tom finds himself sneezing frequently, and initially thinks it's a cold, but assumes it to be a rat problem in their apartment. Azro tries to find the monkey and the Italian mafia members consistently pester him over this.\n\nEva spends some weekends with her father and worries about how she can hide Dodger while she's away. However, Peter leaves a phone message that he's in Canada and can't have her over. She takes advantage of this circumstance to have a personal weekend alone with Dodger at her dad's empty house, and hides his message from her mother and stepfather. She has her best friend Katie(Remy Rya)), and Katie's mother Missy (Deborah White), drive her to her dad's house. During the trip, Eva secretly reveals Dodger to Katie. Once at her destination, Eva realizes that she doesn't have a key to her dad's house; Dodger breaks into the home and opens the door. When they discover that there is no food inside and Eva has not brought any money, the latter decides to busk for earnings with Dodger at Venice Beach boardwalk near Peter's house. While Eva is riding her bike to the boardwalk, Dodger and Azro spot each other, and without Eva being aware, Dodger jumps off her bike, leading to a chase between him and Azro. As Dodger then secretly makes his way back to Eva's bike, Azro is caught by the mafia members who take him away from the scene. Dodger and Eva start their performance with the former secretly pickpocketing everybody just as with when he was with Azro.\n\nAt a grocery store that evening, with Dodger hiding in Eva's backpack, he steals and hides food without Eva knowing. The management of the store, unaware there is a monkey in her backpack, assume Eva is shoplifting, but allows her to return the items without being punished. Eva is puzzled, opens her backpack in a back aisle of the store, and sees the items Dodger stole. When she returns home, she scolds him, and finds more of the stolen items. Now realizing that he was taught how to pickpocket and break into buildings, Eva trains him to quit stealing.\n\nAzro finds out about the supermarket incident, and a store manager gives him Peter's address. Eva is now preparing to return home and calls a taxi when Azro unexpectedly arrives at the house, frightening both Eva and Dodger. The duo escape the house and disconnect Azro's mobile home from his pickup truck just as the taxi arrives and they escape unharmed. Upon arrival home, Tom notices a stolen broach near Eva's foot, but Eva denies any knowledge of it, and withdraws to her room, after Tom mentions a baseball game, where the Dodgers are playing the Pirates. The next day, Azro finds out Dodger is at Annie's pet shop. Azro attacks Annie and steals Dodger back. Azro is aghast when he discovers that the monkey won't steal anymore during a meeting with the mafia members.\n\nMeanwhile, Amy and Tom, who have been dealing with reports of stolen jewelry, discover more stolen property in Eva's room. They confront her about it and she tries to explain about how her hidden monkey must've been responsible for it, but they don't believe her. Things get worse when Peter stops by and reveals that he had been in Canada all weekend, which reveals that Eva has lied about the visit. Already heartbroken at the disappearance of her beloved pet she is also now upset that no one believes her. She runs away to look for Dodger after Katie calls and tells Eva that Dodger is at the park. Meanwhile, Jack ends up saying his first word, \"monkey\", revealing to Amy, Peter, and Tom that there really is a monkey in the house and that Eva had been telling the truth. It is revealed her that Dodger escaped from Azro and returned to Eva's room.\n\nAt the park, Eva is accosted by Azro, who is furious about her teaching Dodger not to steal and kidnaps her to locate the monkey. Eva's family along with Tom's fellow police officers, begin their search for Eva and discover that Dodger saved her after stealing Tom's gun. As Azro and the mafia are arrested in their attempt to escape, Mark tries taking Dodger back, but fails. Eva proves to her mother that she is responsible and her stepfather reveals that he has overcome his fur allergy, having built up a resistance to it. As Dodger becomes the family pet, Eva brings him and Jack to school days later for a sharing time.\n\nReception\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics.\n\nBox office\n\nThe film performed poorly at the box office.

  "Diskeeper\n\nDiskeeper is a discontinued defragmentation app, designed for Microsoft Windows. It was developed by Executive Software International, Inc., which later changed its name to Diskeeper Corporation, and is now called Condusiv Technologies. The final version of Diskeeper was released in March 2020. All of Diskeeper's features and functionality are now included in Condusiv's data performance software DymaxIO.\n\nHistory\n\nOriginally, Diskeeper was developed for the VAX series of minicomputers and later for Microsoft Windows. The defragmentation program which is included with Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 is based on a basic version of Diskeeper. Diskeeper 9.0 (for Windows 2000 and XP) Server Edition introduced Terabyte Volume Engine (TVE), which provides optimal defragmentation performance on volumes of 1 TB and larger. Diskeeper 2008 Professional introduced a Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) compatibility mode, which defragments on a unit of 16 KB, so that VSS file history won't explode, invalidating cached old versions of the files.\n\nFeatures\n\nIn addition to resolving file system fragmentation, Diskeeper also prevents fragmentation before it happens by optimizing the process of data being written to disk. Diskeeper can also defragment files on-the-fly, using only idle system resources as needed.\n\nAnother feature in Diskeeper is I-FAAST, or Intelligent File Access Acceleration Sequencing Technology. I-FAAST determines the frequency of file usage and the most frequently used files are then moved to the best portion of the disc. According to Diskeeper, this results in faster file access and also helps prevent future fragmentation of those files. The I-FAAST feature is available in Professional, Pro Premier and Server editions.\n\nThere are six versions available: Home, Professional, Pro Premier, HomeServer, Server, and EnterpriseServer. Diskeeper Administrator is also available to manage Diskeeper options as well as perform advanced installations. Version 10 was the last version available for Windows 9x. After version 10, Diskeeper versions follow the year based naming convention, that is, 2007, 2008 and so on.\n\nCritical reception\n\nDiskeeper 2009 won Editor's Best Gold Award and Community's Choice Bronze Award for best system utility of 2009 from Windows IT Pro.

  "Unification (album)\n\nUnification is the second studio album by the German power metal band Iron Savior. It continues the science fiction story that began on the first album Iron Savior. It is the only album to feature former Gamma Ray and Freedom Call drummer Dan Zimmermann.\n\nStory\n\nIn the year 2110, earth is controlled by the Iron Savior. The gigantic machine - built in Atlantis to defend the lost continent against its enemies, the so-called Alliance - still is mistaken. The computer-unit analysis identifies man as the destroyer of Atlantis. So it continues to carry out its prime directive: Protect Atlantis and conquer the Alliance.\n\nOn earth only a few people managed to hide from the bloodhounds of the Savior in the former Earth-Defense-Headquarters (E.D.H.) underneath the everlasting ice of Greenland. The machine, from the very first moment of its arrival, was transmitting signals directly to the Atlantic Ocean, North Africa, South America, and the Easter Islands. This behavior led some people to the \"theory of Atlantis\". And in fact after major research for anything related to the old myth, some artifacts were found on the Azores and on the Easter Islands. The dig on the Easter Islands uncovered something like the entrance to an ancient structure of unknown purpose. Shielded and protected by force fields of unknown sources, the station couldn't be entered by anybody yet. But all of a sudden another transmission - similar to the Savior's transmission but yet different - was detected. Sensors indicated that the source must be located right in the heart of the ancient structure.\n\nThe attempts to enter the station made the last Atlantian on earth awake from his 300,000 year long stasis sleep. Now the \"Sleeper\" is the last member alive of the Atlantian Iron Savior Defense program. But when he transmitted the secret codes to direct the controls of the Savior to his station, something unexpected happened. The computer unit refused to obey his command. It almost appeared to him, as if the unit is conscious - with a will of its own, just like an organic life form.\n\nThe awakening of the sleeper and the contact with the last Atlantian on earth brought a lot of clarity and turned the \"theory of Atlantis\" into a hard fact. On the other hand, the situation did not change at all since the machine seems to disobey the orders of its creators. The only chance to fee mankind from the Savior is now awake to bio unit. But even this seems doubtful if the robot in deed developed a consciousness and now acts like a being with emotions and the hunger for power. It is very much likely that the computer will also disobey the orders of the bio unit. So the Savior needs to be defeated or destroyed, which at this time seems to be impossible.\n\nIn this situation a big fleet of alien vessels enters the solar system. They have come from the distant planet of Calderis to investigate the transmission of the Iron Savior. The Calderins are the descendants of the Atlantian fugitives. Their forefathers left the dying civilization of Atlantis to find a new home in the vastness of space. But over the millennia they forgot about their origin and the Old World became a myth of legends and tales. But the Calderins never gave up the search although thousands of expeditions returned to Calderis without a clue. But this time they have reached their final destiny.\n\nTogether with the sleeper mankind is unable to make contact and explain the fatal mistake of the Savior. So now with the unexpected help from the stars, earth will fight the final battle and it seems that the Savior can be defeated.\n\nAnd the time of Unification for all mankind is about to come...\n\nTrivia\n\nSwiss power metal band Excelsis won a competition during Iron Savior's 1998 Atlantis Falling tour, for their contribution of their song \"Dragonslayer\", which earned them a featured guest spot on the album."
