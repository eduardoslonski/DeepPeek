  "No, the only the theory that was any good for what Alhazen was interested in, like reflection, refraction, rainbows, why the Sun got big at sunset, was the theory that said \"light did come into your eye\nfrom all the objects around you\".\n\"True,\" said Alhazen, \"and the reason it doesn't confuse your eye, is because the rays act selectively.\nObjects do send off rays, but only the ones going straight into your eyes, the so-called centric rays make you see.\nThe ones that come in at an angle, get bent, defracted, so you don't see them.\nAnd, big, near objects make more of those rays than little distant ones.\nSo, you end up, overall, with a visual pyramid of rays coming in from everything out-there and, converging on your eye.\"\nBlindingly obvious to you, knockout theoretical physics to the 15th century students here.\nIncluding one from Florence, a fellow called Paolo Toscanelli, who thought the sun rose and set on Alhazen.\nSome time around 1424, Toscanelli, on the right, was out to dinner, back in Florence when he met an architect called Brunelleschi, who was one of those people trying to do bigger and better than the ancient Romans,\nso he had a problem.\nToscanelli, with his theoretical science background, was a godsend.\nToscanelli had ideas based on all that optical theory he had learnt in Padua, that might give architects the help they all needed.\nYou remember that Ptolemy atlas the Florentines had brought back from Greece, with grids all over it?\nToscanelli came across things in the Atlas that were right up Brunelleschi's street.\nLike how Ptolemy had used grids as a standard unit of measure, and how he must have used optical theory to get the foreshortening effect of the grids that would recreate the effects of the Earth's curving surface.\nThe same optical theory that Alhazen had developed, you recall, about the way rays of light came into the eye from outside.\nAnd how the way you saw things was something that could be handled with geometry and maths.\nYou can guess what must have been going through Brunelleschi's mind as he watched Toscanelli.\nIf he could understand enough of this fancy geometry to produce some kind of blueprint, his troubles might be over, because he could get a proper scientific grip on things he was trying to build.\nIncluding a crazy scheme he had taken on, to give the Florentines something even bigger than the Romans had managed,\nto put the biggest dome ever built on their unfinished cathedral.\nHe had this imaginative way of doing it.",

  "The discovery of oxygen was given meaning by the clear revolutionary mind of Lavoisier, who perished in the French Revolution.\nLavoisier repeated an experiment of Priestley's, which is almost a caricature of one of the classical experiments of alchemy.\nBoth men heated the red oxide of mercury using a burning glass - the burning glass was fashionable just then - in a vessel in which they could see gas being produced and could collect it.\nThe gas was oxygen.\nThat was the qualitative experiment, but to Lavoisier it was the instant clue that chemical decomposition could be quantified.\nThe idea was simple and radical:\nRun the experiment in both directions and measure the quantities exactly.\nBurn mercury so that it absorbs oxygen, and measure the exact quantity of oxygen that is taken up between the beginning of the burning and the end.\nNow turn the process into reverse.\nTake the mercuric oxide that has been made, heat it vigorously and expel the oxygen from it again.\nMercury is left behind, oxygen flows into the vessel, and the crucial question is:\nHow much?\nExactly the amount that was taken up before.\nSuddenly the process is a material one.\nEssences, principles, phlogiston have disappeared, two concrete elements have really been put together and taken apart.\nAfter the fire, the sulphur, the burning mercury, it was inevitable that the climax of the story should take place in the chill damp of Manchester.\nHere, between 1803 and 1808, a Quaker schoolmaster called John Dalton turned the vague knowledge of chemical combination, brilliantly illuminated as it had been by Lavoisier, suddenly into the precise modern conception of atomic theory.\nIt was a time of marvellous discovery in chemistry.\nIn those five years, ten new elements were found.\nAnd yet, Dalton was not interested in any of that.\nHe was, to tell the truth, a somewhat colourless man.\nHe was certainly colour-blind.\nHe was a man of regular habits, who walked out every Thursday afternoon to play bowls in the countryside.",

  "Now, the idea is that gravity might be like the sound waves- it might not be confined to our membrane.\nIt might be able to seep off our part of the universe.\nOr... think about it another way.\nInstead of pool tables, let's go back to bread.\nImagine that our universe is like this slice of toast and that you and me and all of matter, light itself, everything we see, is like jelly.\nNow, jelly can move freely on the surface of the toast, but otherwise, it's stuck.\nIt can't leave the surface itself.\nBut what if gravity were different?\nWhat if gravity were more like cinnamon and sugar?\nNow, this stuff isn't sticky at all, so it easily slides right off the surface.\nBut why would gravity be so different from everything else that we know of in the universe?\nWell, turns out that string theory- or M-theory- provides an answer.\nIt all has to do with shape.\nFor years, we concentrated on strings that were closed loops, like rubber bands.\nBut after M-theory, we turned our attention to other kinds.\nNow we think that everything we see around us, like matter and light, is made of open-ended strings, and the ends of each string are tied down to our three-dimensional membrane.\nBut closed loops of string do exist, and one kind is responsible for gravity.\nIt's called a graviton.\nWith closed loops, there are no loose ends to tie down, so gravitons are free to escape into the other dimensions, diluting the strength of gravity and making it seem weaker than the other forces of nature.\nThis suggests an intriguing possibility.\nand there are parallel universes on other membranes near us, we may never see them, but perhaps we could one day feel them through gravity.\nIf there happens to be intelligent life on one of the membranes, then this intelligent life might be very close to us.\nSo theoretically, and purely theoretically, we might be able to communicate with this intelligent life by exchanging strong gravity wave sources.",
